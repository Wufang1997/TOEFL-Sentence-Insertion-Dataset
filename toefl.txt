Context: For years, scholars argued that the practices of cultivation and animal domestication were invented in one or two locations on Earth and then diffused from those centers of innovation. [A] Genetic studies are now showing that many different groups of people in many different places around the globe learned independently to create especially useful plants and animals through selective breeding. [B] Probably both independent invention and diffusion played a role in agricultural innovation. [C] Sometimes the ideas of domestication and cultivation were relayed to new places. In other cases the farmers or herders themselves moved into new zones, taking agriculture or improvements such as new tools or new methods or new plants and animals with them. [D]
Question: Among the many places that are now known to be centers of independent domestication are Mesopotamia, Central China, and Mesoamerica.
Answer: B

Context: The bacterial oxygen release improved conditions for life in two ways. First, oxygen is essential for the metabolic process known as cell respiration that allows cells to efficiently harvest energy from organic food. Second, oxygen in the upper atmosphere reacts to form a protective shield of ozone. [A] Earth is constantly bombarded by harmful ultraviolet (UV radiation from the Sun. [B] Today, Earth’s upper-atmosphere ozone shield absorbs enough UV to allow diverse forms of life to survive. [C] But because early Earth lacked oxygen in its atmosphere, it also lacked a protective ozone barrier. [D] As a result, early life on Earth was confined to the oceans, where the water absorbed the UV radiation. Only after oxygen released by ancient bacteria drifted up into the upper atmosphere and reacted with other oxygen molecules to form a protective layer of ozone, could life flourish at the surface and on the land. The absence of an oxygen atmosphere on Mars and other planets in our solar system means that these planets also lack an ozone shield that would protect surface-dwelling life from UV radiation. The surface of Mars is bombarded with deadly radiation; if any life exists on Mars, it would almost certainly be subterranean.
Question: But protection against what?
Answer: A

Context: The Navigation Acts also barred the export of certain “enumerated goods” to foreign nations unless those items first passed through England or Scotland. The American mainland’s chief items of this sort were tobacco, rice, furs, indigo (a Carolina plant that produced a blue dye), and naval supplies (such as masts and tar). Parliament never restricted grain, livestock, fish, lumber, or rum, which altogether made up 60 percent of American colonial exports. Furthermore, Anglo-American exporters of tobacco and rice—the chief commodities affected by enumeration—had their burdens reduced by two significant concessions. [A] First, Parliament gave tobacco growers a monopoly over the British market by excluding foreign tobacco, even though this hurt British consumers. [B] (Rice planters enjoyed a natural monopoly because they had no competitors.) [C] Second, Parliament tried to minimize the added cost of landing tobacco and rice in Britain (where customs officials collected duties on both) by refunding the duties on all tobacco and rice that the colonists later shipped to other countries. [D]
Question: About 85 percent of all North American tobacco and rice was eventually reexported and sold outside the British Empire.
Answer: D

Context: The technological and managerial innovations of Thomas Alva Edison (the inventor of electricity) and the industrial leaders Andrew Carnegie (iron and steel) and John D. Rockefeller (oil) proved readily adaptable throughout United States industry, spurring marvels of productivity. [A] Late-nineteenth-century industrialists often discovered that their factories produced more goods than the market could absorb. [B] This was particular true in two kinds of businesses: those that manufactured devices for individual use, such as sewing machines and farm implements, and those that mass-produced consumer goods, such as matches, flour, soap, canned foods, and processed meats. [C] Not surprisingly, these industries were trailblazers in developing advertising and marketing techniques. [D] Strategies for encouraging consumer demand and for differentiating one product from another were an important component of the American post-Civil War industrial transformation.
Question: Edison’s laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, even became a model for the industrial research laboratories established by other corporations.
Answer: A

Context: [A] Masks (see figure above) are the most varied of the carvings from the Northwest, where they were an essential part of communal life. [B] In style they range from an almost abstract symbolism to combinations of human and animal features and to a lifelike naturalism sometimes bordering on caricature (a style that strongly exaggerates features or characteristics), taken to its extreme in Tlingit war helmets. Some differences must have been due to those among the cultures in which they were created, but their place of origin cannot always be ascertained as they seem to have passed from one contiguous nation to another in the course of trade or warfare. [C] Although carvers worked according to established conventions, no two masks are identical and those with basic similarities reveal varying degrees of skill. [D]
Question: If we consider 100 raven masks made by different carvers, for example, some will have been well executed, others less so, and one may have been made by an exceptional carver.
Answer: D

Context: Along with the buildup of molecular oxygen (O2) came an eventual increase in ozone (O3) levels in the atmosphere. [A] Because ozone filters out harmful ultraviolet radiation, this made it possible for life to flourish in shallow water and finally on land. [B] This critical state in the evolution of the atmosphere was reached between 1100 and 542 million years ago.[C] Interestingly, the fossil record shows an explosion of life forms 542 million years ago. [D]
Question: The timing strongly suggests that atmospheric changes were responsible for this sudden increase in new life.
Answer: D

Context: When some people began to settle down and produce their food through farming and animal domestication – starting about 10,000 years ago – the first epidemiological transition occurred. [A] Infectious diseases increased in impact, as larger and denser concentrations of people provided greater opportunity for disease to be passed from host to host. [B] Animal domestication may have brought people into contact with new diseases previously limited to other species. [C] Working the soil would have exposed farmers to insects and other pathogens. Irrigation in some areas provided breeding places for mosquitoes, increasing the incidence of malaria and other mosquito-borne diseases. [D]
Question: But the denser populations of agricultural communities were only one of many factors contributing to the increased risk of disease.
Answer: B

Context: Raw materials, not equipment, constituted artisans’ major expense in most traders, however. [A] Whereas in 1583 an Antwerp silk weaver paid 12 guilders for a loom (and made small payments over many years to pay off the debt for purchasing the loom), every six weeks he or she had to lay out 24 guilders for the 2 pounds of raw silk required to make a piece of cloth. [B] Thus access to cheap and plentiful primary materials was a constant preoccupation for independent producers. [C] Using local materials might allow even the poorest among them to avoid reliance on merchant 394 suppliers. [D] The loss of nearby sources could therefore be devastating. As silk cultivation waned around the Spanish cities of Cordoba and Toledo, weavers in these cities were forced to become employees of merchants who put out raw silk from Valencia and Murcia provinces. In the Dutch Republic, merchants who imported unprocessed salt from France, Portugal, and Spain gained control of the salt-refining industry once exploitation of local salt marshes was halted for fear that dikes (which held back the sea from the low-lying Dutch land) would be undermined.
Question: This was possible because when transportation costs were low, the price of raw materials was generally also low.
Answer: D

Context: Another hypothesis was proposed by German paleontologist Rolf Kohring, whose specialty is fossil eggs. In Kohring's model, amphibians during the Mississippian epoch (360¨C320 million years ago) spread into nutrient-poor or cooler water. Because of the harsher conditions, eggs were produced with larger yolks, that is, more nutrients for the embryo. [A] With larger yolks, the eggs were bigger, and fewer of them could be produced by the female--hundreds rather than thousands. [B] To keep the larger egg intact, one or more membranes were developed, including one that surrounded and protected the egg. [C] This outer membrane provided a place to safely store calcium ions, which are poisonous. [D] Accumulating the calcium in a hard shell then made it possible for the egg to be laid on land (it was pre-adapted to be laid there.)
Question: And the relatively few that were produced had to be properly protected.
Answer: B

Context: In late seventeenth-century Europe, what had been evolution in population followed by stabilization changed to population revolution. [A] Increasing contacts with the Americas brought more sophisticated knowledge of the advantages of new foods, particularly the potato. [B] Originally a cool-weather mountain crop in the Americas, potatoes did well in the Pyrenees, Alps, and Scottish Highlands. [C] They also grew well in the long, damp springtime of the northwest European plain. [D] Whatever hesitancy peasants may have felt about eating potatoes quickly passed when famine threatened; after all, people who in famines desperately consumed grass, weeds, and the bark of trees hardly would have hesitated to eat a potato. By the later eighteenth and the nineteenth century, American foods had become the principal foodstuffs of many rural folk. Various agricultural publicists promoted adoption of these foods, and peasants found that potatoes could allow subsistence on smaller plots of land. Fried potatoes soon began to be sold on the streets of Paris in the 1680s the original French fries. Governments, eager to promote population growth as a source of military and economic strength, also backed the potato.
Question: What were the factors that led to this population revolution
Answer: A

Context: [A] The Mexican muralist movement is undoubtedly one of the most important manifestations of twentieth-century Mexican culture. [B] Its impact elsewhere in the region, as well as in the United States and Europe, has been enormous. [C] The work of Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros triggered a homegrown muralist movement in the United States in cities like New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. [D] The influence of the Mexicans on the modern Spanish painter Picasso's first mural and almost his only major explicitly propagandist work of art his famous Guernica of 1937 is unmistakable even though the artist himself would have denied it. In Latin America, Mexican-influenced muralism has recurred whenever artists have felt the need to make a clear, public statement in a language that has not been borrowed from outside.
Question: However, its influence was not limited to Mexico itself.
Answer: B

Context: Oxen are slow and unintelligent compared to horses, but peasants could not use horses to pull plows until they devised a different kind of harnessing than the strap that circled an ox's neck. [A] With a harness resting on its shoulders instead of its neck, a horse could be used to plow, and horses could walk more quickly and work longer hours than oxen. [B] They also required less guidance, since they understood verbal signals to turn or to stop. [C] Heavier, wheeled plows pulled by suitably harnessed horses meant that peasants could work more land in a day than ever before. [D] Whether an increase in population across western Europe, but particularly in the  north, stimulated innovations or whether such innovations contributed to a rise in  population, the cumulative effect of these changes in agriculture was apparent in the 58 tenth century. Conditions in Europe were ripe for an economic and cultural upswing.
Question: A stronger part of the body had to bear the strain of pulling for the horse to become a useful farm animal.
Answer: A

Context: Gliding is gravity-powered flight where the movement of the glider has a downward tilt. But many birds are capable of ascending without flapping their wings,  and this is called soaring.[A] Birds usually soar by finding air that is rising as fast as  or faster than the gliding bird's sinking speed.[B] For example, a turkey vulture  might glide with a sinking speed of about 0.8 meters per second. [C] If the vulture can find a place where the air is rising at 0.8 meters per second, it will be able to maintain a constant altitude. [D] If it finds air rising faster than that, it will be able to climb.
Question: Soaring uses energy such as rising air currents to allow birds to increase time aloft.
Answer: A

Context: One problem with the prehistoric overkill hypothesis is that archaeological evidence indicates the early human inhabitants of North and South America, as well as Australia, probably lived in small, scattered communities, gathering food and hunting. How could a few hunters destroy so many species of large mammals. [A] However, it is true that humans have caused major extinctions on oceanic islands.[B] For example, in a period of about 600 years after arriving in New Zealand, humans exterminated several species of the large, flightless birds called moas. [C] A second problem is that present-day hunters concentrate on smaller, abundant, and less dangerous animals. [D] The remains of horses, reindeer, and other small animals are found in many prehistoric sites in Europe, whereas mammoth and woolly rhinoceros remains are scarce. Finally, few human artifacts are found among the remains of extinct animals in North and South America, and there is usually little evidence that the animals were hunted. Countering this argument is the assertion that the impact on the previously unhunted fauna was so swift as to leave little evidence.
Question: It should be noted, however, that island conditions that lead to extinction, such as limited space to escape predators, do not apply to landmasses such as continents.
Answer: C

Context: The rise of civilization brought with it a far more complex division of labor and system of economic organization. [A] Full-time artisans specialized in the manufacture of textiles and pottery, metalworking, and other crafts. [B] The professions of architecture, engineering, and medicine, among others, were born. [C] Weights and measures were systematized, mathematics was invented, and primitive forms of science emerged. [D] Since Sumer was virtually (devoid of) natural resources other than its rich soil, it traded with other people, thereby contributing to the (diffusion) of Sumerian civilization. The scarcity of stone, for tools as well as for buildings, probably hastened the adoption of copper and bronze. Copper, at least, was already known before the rise of Sumerian civilization, but lack of demand for it among the Stone Age peasant villages inhibited its widespread use.
Question: For example, the Sumerians learned to use the position of the stars and planets to predict weather and for traveling at night.
Answer: D

Context: This last idea may partly explain why no similar explosion of diversity has taken place since the Cambrian: once predators were efficient and widespread, it may have been virtually impossible for animals with entirely new body forms to find an environmental niche in which they could escape predation. [A] Or it may be that while more body plans may have been possible at some early point in evolution, it was not possible to evolve into those other body plans from the body plans that evolved in the Cambrian. [B] Or perhaps the various body forms that arose during the Cambrian explosion represent the full range of forms possible given the basic genetic resources that characterize all Earth's organisms. [C] In any case, no fundamentally new body forms have emerged since the Cambrian explosion. [D]
Question: After all, evolution of body structure can act only on the structure that already exists.
Answer: B

Context: Knifefish also display a (peculiar) behavior called the jamming avoidance response. [A] This response allows knifefish to prevent interference with their electric system when they meet other knifefish. [B] In order to avoid confusion, an electric fish must somehow keep track of the discharge rate of another knifefish while remaining aware of its own. [C] If the two rates are too close, each fish alters its frequency of discharge so as to widen the gap between the two. [D] In a sense, they do not want to get their wires crossed. In the laboratory, it is possible, using artificial signals, to force a knifefish to decrease its frequency of firing just by exposing it to a high but slowly decreasing signal rate or to increase its frequency of firing by switching to a low but slowly rising signal rate.
Question: Each fish in an encounter is discharging electric signals at a specific rate.
Answer: B

Context: A second development of the early 1840s also influenced the nature of the illustrations in pictorial weeklies worldwide.[A] If the arrival of the electrotype had made the high-volume printing of large, finely engraved illustrations possible, the emergence of photography gave many of these images a distinctive character.[B] Soon after the daguerreotype (the earliest photographic process) had swept the world in the early 1840s, artists for pictorial weeklies began to use these early photographs as sources for their illustrations. [C] The growing presence of woodblock-engraved portraits in the weeklies in the 1840s and 1850s arose directly from the popularity of portrait photographs, any of which could easily be mailed or shipped anywhere in the world.[D] In 1857 the artist Winnslow Homer in Boston copied onto a woodblock a daguerreotype portrait of a sea captain who lived in California thereby allowing the captain’s likeness to reach publication in the Companion without the subject’s having been within a few thousand miles of the artist who had drawn him. Nothing quite like this had been possible so routinely or with such ease before the introduction of the daguerreotype in France in 1839 and its rapid spread elsewhere.
Question: This was photography.
Answer: A

Context: With their very existence dependent on the successful production of food, farmers had little, if any, time for removing stumps and stones. Instead, they adapted to the half-cleared fields by planting corn (maize) and grass, both grew well in such an environment. [A] A pattern of “extensive” farming began to emerge. [B] Rather than carefully tending arable land, engaging in crop rotation, manuring, and removing all stumps and stones—all recognized as part of proper agricultural practice in Europe—New England farmers simply exploited the soil and then forged ahead with the cleaning of new land. [C] Cutting down trees remained hard work, but it was easier to partially clear the land, plant it, and then move on to another small plot than to constantly improve the soil on one field to the high Old World (European) standards.[D] The settlers were too busy figuring out how to produce food rapidly to worry about efficient agricultural practices.
Question: This way of farming differed considerably from the European system.
Answer: B

Context: Unfortunately, most cave art works are extremely fragile. When a cave is opened and the conditions that enable the paintings to survive are altered, deterioration can be rapid. [A] Thus except in places where expensive air-conditioning has been installed, caves are no longer open to the public. [B] Even the Altamira cave in Spain, finest of them all, is now open only to small parties for brief periods. [C] Scholars themselves find it difficult to gain admission. Some of these works are photographed, but the camera gives a poor idea of their nature and quality. [D] Some are difficult to see anyway: the best part of Altamira has to be studied lying down. Hence inaccessibility is a real and growing obstacle to unlocking the secrets of the Magdalenian art system. 
Question: There is a potential for serious damage from the introduction of light, changes in air circulation, and the breath of visitors.
Answer: A

Context: Most other trees shed only branches that prove unproductive. If a branch is not producing enough carbohydrate to cover its own running costs—i.e., it needs to be subsidized by other branches because, for example, it is being shaded and receives little light—it will usually be got rid of. This prevents unproductive branches from being a drain on the tree and removes the wind drag (the force of air resistance) from useless branches. [A] Branches are shed for reasons other than lack of light. [B] In dry parts of the world, it is common for trees and shrubs to lose smaller branches to save water. [C] Small branches have the thinnest bark (the protective outer covering of a tree) and greatest surface area and thus are the source of most water loss once the leaves have been lost. [D] The creosote bush of United States deserts self-prunes, or removes parts of itself, in the face of extreme heat or drought, starting from the highest and most exposed twigs and working downward to bigger and bigger branches, it’s a desperate act because if the creosote bush loses too much food, it dies. 
Question: A tree will also shed branches if its water supply is insufficient.
Answer: B

Context: Geologists working during the nineteenth century understood that if they were to discover the actual age of Earth or of particular rock bodies, they would have to concentrate on natural processes that continue at a constant rate and that also leave some sort of tangible record in the rocks. Evolution is one such process, and geologist Charles Lyell (1797-1875) recognized this. [A] By comparing the amount of evolution exhibited by marine mollusks during the Tertiary Period with the amount that had occurred since then, Lyell estimated that 80 million years had elapsed since the beginning of the Tertiary Period. He came astonishingly close to the mark, since it was actually about 65 million years. [B] However, for older sequences of evolutionary development, estimates based on rates of evolution were difficult, and not only because of missing parts in the fossil record.[C] Rates of evolution for many orders of plants and animals were not well understood. [D]
Question: More fundamentally, Lyell's evolutionary approach is intrinsically limited because Earth existed long before life and evolution began.
Answer: D

Context: The body forms of sit-and-wait foragers may reflect selective pressures different from those that act on active foragers.[A]Sit-and-wait lizards are often stout bodied, short tailed, and colored to match their background. [B]Many of these species have patterns of different-colored blotches that probably obscure the outlines of the lizard's body as it rests motionless on a rock or a tree trunk. [C]Active foragers are usually slim and elongated with long tails, and they often have patterns of stripes that may produce optical illusions as they move. [D]However, one predator-avoidance mechanism, the ability to break off their tails when they are seized by predators, does not differ among lizards with different foraging modes. 
Question: Such visual effects make it harder for predators to catch these moving targets.
Answer: D

Context: While the Romans were thus distracted by internal conflict, other tribes seized the opportunity to cross into Roman territory unopposed. [A] When the Romans could not dislodge them, peace was bought with further titles and territorial concessions as allies. [B] In the midst of it all, alliances and coalitions between Roman emperors or powerful commanders and various tribes or tribal kings were made, unmade, and remade so often that it is nearly impossible to follow their course. [C] Accordingly, all of these situations proved dangerous to the peace and safety of the West. [D]
Question: Once within Roman borders, they proved difficult to remove.
Answer: A

Context: Arboreal (tree-living) mammals such as monkeys and sloths are plentiful in tropical forests, probably because there is a rich, resource-filled, dense canopy to occupy and feed in. The closed canopy blocks light to the ground, which allows only an undergrowth that is sparse and poor in resources, and consequently permits few opportunities for mammals to live and feed there.[A] Bats thrive in the tropics, being very successful both in terms of number of species and in their abundances.[B]Nine families of bats occur in Brazil, including more than 140 species; only four families and 40 species occur in the entire United States, an area similar in size to Brazil[C]While most North American bats feed on insects, the diets of Brazilian bats are more varied and include fruit, nectar, and fish.[D]
Question: A possible explanation for this difference is related to what they eat.
Answer: C

Context: Honeybee colonies are essentially societies of females. In a hive of perhaps 20,000 bees, only a few hundred will be male bees, called drones.[A]They are around only in the spring or summerlong enough to rise to treetop level in a comet-like swarm, chasing after one of the queen bees that have assembled from various hives at a mating site.[B]Of the many drones assembled, only 10 to 15 will actually mate with a queen during one of her mating flights.[C]Each drone that is successful dies in the process, however, and a similar fate awaits drones that aren't successful; once mating is done, they will be expelled from their hives or killed. [D]
Question: Lacking the body parts to collect nectar and pollen, they have no function in the community once the opportunity to mate has passed.
Answer: D

Context: Harkins and Jackson found that social loafing disappeared when participants in a group believed that each person's performance could be monitored and evaluated; indeed, even the idea that the group performance may be evaluated against some standard can be sufficient to eliminate the loafing effect. [A]When a group is relatively small and group evaluation is important, some members will even expend extra effort if they know that some of their coworkers are unwilling, unreliable, or incompetent to perform well. [B]Moreover, social loafing is unlikely when participants can evaluate their own individual contribution or when they have a personal stake in the outcome. [C]It is also unlikely when participants feel that the task is challenging or when they are working with close friends or teammates. Some 80 experimental studies have been conducted on social loafing in diverse cultures. Based on evidence these studies have produced, social loafing probably occurs in almost all cultures. [D]
Question: However, it appears to be most common in individualistic Western cultures such as that of the United States.
Answer: D

Context: Why would there be a difference between singing in nature and singing in the laboratory? [A] The pressures of nature. [B] As year-round residents, the San Francisco white-crowns do not fly into an area in spring and then establish territories. [C] Rather, they establish territories as early as their first autumn. [D] One function of birdsong is to announce, I have a territory here.
Question: So San Francisco white-crowns need to start quickly making their presence known.
Answer: D

Context: Cereals are flowering grasses that sprout, flower, seed, and die in the space of a year, which is why gardeners refer to them as annuals. [A]Grown for their seeds or kernels, cereals are excellent sources of energy: although they lack some amino acids, as well as calcium, vitamin A, and vitamin C, they provide starch and oil, and in some cases, considerable amounts of protein. [B] Once ripe, the kernels are relatively easy to store, and they retain their nutrients for a long time. Even the stalks of cereals are useful as animal food, as bedding in stables and barns, and as a building material. [C] A major drawback with cereals is that they depend on the soil for nitrogen. [D] Without fertilization they eventually exhaust the fields they are growing in, but despite this, two cereals (wheat and barley) were the very first plants to be domesticated (grown for human use); and a third (rye) may have been cultivated, or even domesticated, at about the same time. Today, cereal crops including wheat, rice, maize, sorghum, millet, and oats provide most of the calories in the human diet.
Question: Although they must be replanted each year, they can be grown for a variety of uses.
Answer: A

Context: [A] Ecosystem changes always hurt some living creatures and help others. It's hard to say, therefore, whether a change is good or bad overall. [B] Instead, ecologists (people who study ecosystems) often focus on the impacts on a single species: for instance, us. [C] In the short term, the Alaskan spruce beetle epidemic supplied a lot of people with firewood, but only by destroying tons of otherwise valuable timber and threatening the livelihoods of loggers. [D] And no one knows for sure what the long-term impacts on the forest will be.
Question: But even from this limited perspective, the answer is not completely straightforward.
Answer: C

Context: [A] The development of reaching begins early on in life. Newborn infants seated in an upright position will swipe and reach towards an object placed in front of them, a behavior labeled "prereaching." [B] These poorly coordinated behaviors start to decline around two months of age and are replaced by "directed reaching" which begins at about three months of age. [C] At this time reaching becomes more coordinated and efficient, and improves in accuracy. [D] According to research conducted by Clifton et al., the infant's reaching does not depend simply on the guidance of the hand and arm by the visual system but is controlled by proprioception, the sensation of movement and location based on the stimulation arising from bodily sources such as muscle contractions.
Question: What accounts for this greater accuracy?
Answer: D

Context: Termites are insects that collect vegetation, chew it up, and leave the chemical breakdown to other organisms. [A] There are two strategies. The most primitive termites swallow the chewed vegetation and pass it to a fermentation chamber in their bodies. [B]There, anaerobic bacteria break down the cellulose, an organic compound that forms about 33 percent of all plant matter. The termites are nourished by the ever-growing population of microorganisms in their guts that turn the grass, leaves, and twigs the insects ingest into glucose. [C] Cattle do much the same thing: they allow bacteria to ferment the cellulose in an airtight rumen (digestive chamber), and then digest the bacteria. [D]
Question: This remarkable adaptation, however, is not unique to termites.
Answer: C

Context: [A]The creation of life requires a set of chemical elements for making the components of cells. [B]Life on Earth uses about 25 of the 92 naturally occurring chemical elements, although just 4 of these elements oxygen, carbon, hydrogen, and nitrogen make up about 96 percent of the mass of living organisms. [C]Thus, a first requirement for life might be the presence of most or all of the elements used by life. [D]
Question: To answer the question “Could life exist on other planets”, we must first look at the necessary preconditions for life.
Answer: A

Context: Significant concentrations of commercial agriculture first formed in areas easily accessible by water, such as the Danube River basin. During the nineteenth century, expansion in such areas continued, and interior regions joined the list as well. [A] There were also some increases in productivity. [B] Irrigation projects, one form of intensive agriculture, developed in some areas, and the use of modern agricultural tools increased. [C] But more intensive exploitation of existing resources remained comparatively unusual, and most increases in production derived from placing additional land under cultivation. [D]
Question: These increases resulted from using technology to improve yields on existing farmland, a system known as intensive agriculture.
Answer: B

Context: The supply of goods was also significantly modified. [A] Migration had long been critical for the (diffusion) of knowledge that spawned new trades or revived others. Now thousands of workers, and sizeable amounts of capital, moved from one region to another. [B] At the same time, new commodities appeared on the market, often broadening and deepening demand. [C] Most were inexpensive items destined for individual consumers. [D] Knitted stockings, ribbon and lace, buttons, starch, soap, vinegar brewed from beer, knives and tools, pots and ovens, and many more goods, formerly made only for local sale, now entered into channels of national or international trade.
Question: For example, during this period, international investment in Switzerland rapidly expanded after the country was flooded by skilled workers fleeing religious persecution in Italy and France.
Answer: B

Context: Egypt, however, was not without urban centers. [A] At points where goods entered the Nile valley via maritime routes or overland routes from the Red Sea via wadis (stream beds that remain dry except during the rainy season), the right circumstances existed for the growth of larger cities. [B] Egyptian cities and towns shared certain characteristics with other (contemporary societies) but also displayed unique traits influenced by the culture and environment of the Nile valley. [C] Thus, the geopolitical system that evolved in ancient Egypt was different from that of Mesopotamia; Egypt developed a village or territorial state characterized by dispersed settlements of varying size, a form of urbanism that gave Egypt its distinctive identity. [D]
Question: For example, Egypt's capital, Memphis, was located at a strategic point near the mouth of the Nile and grew to be one of the largest settlements of its time.
Answer: B

Context: What is found in and just above the boundary layer between the deposits of the Cretaceous and those of the Tertiary (65¨C2.6 million years ago), termed the K/T boundary?[A]For a very short period the dominant microorganisms in marine deposits were usually diatoms and dinoflagellates (both single-celled types of plankton).[B]The important feature for the survival of both these groups was the ability to form protective cysts (sacs around organisms) that rested on the sea floor. Above these, in the later deposits, are the remains of other minute plankton, but the types are quite different from those of the Late Cretaceous. [C]In terrestrial deposits a sudden and dramatic increase in fern plant spores marks the boundary in many parts of the world; ferns are early colonizers of barren landscapes. The fern spike (sudden increase), as it is termed, has been found also in some marine deposits (such was the abundance of fern spores blown around the world), and it occurs in exactly the same layer of deposit where the plankton disappear. We can conclude that the major marine and terrestrial events occurred simultaneously. [D]
Question: This change in plankton found in marine deposits is what marks the boundary between the Cretaceous and the Tertiary.
Answer: C

Context: One of the most distinctive fossil plants of this hypothetical continent is called Glossopteris. [A] When first described by the French paleobotanist Adolphe Brongniart in 1828, Glossopteris was thought to be a type of fern. [B] Now, however, it is known to be a woody seed-bearing shrub or tree. [C] The trunks of Glossopteris could reach 4 meters in height. [D] Seeds and pollen-containing organs were borne in clusters at the tips of slender stalks attached to the leaves, but some species may have borne seeds in cones.
Question: This led to its name, which means tongue fern in Greek and is a reference to its tongue-shaped leaves.
Answer: B

Context: Simply removing the dams will not restore the salmon, however. [A] Where 50-kilogram king salmon once fought their way up waterfalls to lay their eggs in gravel beds, there now are only concrete walls holding back still water and deep beds of muddy deposits. [B] Removing the mud, uncovering gravel beds where fish spawn, and finding suitable salmon types to rebuild the population is a daunting task. [C] Congress will have to appropriate somewhere around $300 to $400 million to remove these two relatively small dams and rehabilitate the area. [D]
Question: But aside from the technical challenges, the project will also pose a serious financial challenge.
Answer: C

Context: Long before modern radiocarbon dating testified to the antiquity of this culture, archaeologists and art historians had become aware of the power of Olmec art through individual objects. [A] Some even identified the Olmec culture as the oldest of Mesoamerican civilizations, perhaps a mother culture from which all others derived, as the art historian Miguel Covarrubias once thought. [B] Eventually the antiquity of Olmec culture was confirmed, and today many important elements of Mesoamerican art and architecture can be seen to have had a probable Olmec origin: ball courts, pyramids, portraiture, and mirrors. [C] Some later Mesoamerican deities probably derive from Olmec gods, and even the famous “Maya” calendar was already in use by peoples in the Olmec area at the dawn of Maya civilization. [D] 
Question: But these opinions lacked proof.
Answer: B

Context: When solar radiation strikes water, some is reflected, but most penetrates the surface and is ultimately absorbed. [A] Although water may appear transparent, it is much denser than air and absorbs radiation rapidly. [B] In clear water, 99 percent of the solar radiation is absorbed in the upper 50 to 100 meters. [C] Longer wavelengths of light are absorbed first; the shorter wavelengths (which have more energy) penetrate farther, giving the depths their characteristic blue color. [D]
Question: If the water is clouded by many microscopic organisms, absorption occurs even closer to the surface.
Answer: C

Context: The first of these is the rapport existing between actor and audience. [A] Both are breathing the same air; both are involved at the same time and in the same space with the stage life depicted by the play. [B] Sometimes their mutual fascination is almost palpable; every actor's performance is affected by the way the audience yields or withholds its responses: its laughter, sighs, applause, gasps, silences. [C] Live theatrical performance is always a two-way communication between stage and house.[D]
Question: Such signs of an audience's engagement thus become part of every performance.
Answer: C

Context: The precursor phenomena can be grouped into stages according to the dilatancy model. Stage I consists of a gradual stress buildup along the fault. Stages II and III are correlated with dilatancy and water influx. Stage IV is the major earthquake, and stage V is the aftermath of the event. [A] If every earthquake followed the sequence with uniform stage duration, earthquake prediction would be a simple matter. [B] Instead of following the same patterns, each earthquake is unique in terms of specific precursor behavior patterns and length of precursor stages. [C] A magnitude 6.9 North American earthquake in 1989 was preceded by a substantially smaller magnitude 5 earthquake fifteen months before the event. [D] Another foreshock of similar size occurred two months before the event.
Question: But the reality of earthquake forecasting is considerably more complex.
Answer: B

Context: A final theory differs from the others in suggesting that it is the presence of dipterocarp trees themselves that is driving the evolution of gliding species. [A] According to this view, dipterocarp forests can be “food-deserts” for the animals that live in them. [B] The animals living in dipterocarp forests that have evolved gliding consist of two main feeding groups, leaf eaters and carnivores that eat small prey such as insects and small vertebrates. [C] For leaf-eating gliders the problem is not the absence of any leaves but the desert-like absence of edible leaves. Dipterocarp trees often account for 50 percent or more of the total number of canopy trees in a forest and over 95 percent of the large trees, yet dipterocarp leaves are unavailable to most vertebrate plant eaters because of the high concentration of toxic chemicals in their leaves. [D] Many species of gliding animals avoid eating dipterocarp leaves and so must travel widely through the forest, bypassing the dipterocarp trees, to find the leaves they need to eat.
Question: For each group, a dipterocarp forest is like a desert in that food resources are few and far apart.
Answer: C

Context: [A] One of the time-tested methods of dealing with water erosion is terracing—creating hill-side ridges—to reduce runoff. [B] Another newer, highly effective tool in the soil conservation tool kit is conservation tillage, which includes both no tillage and minimum tillage. [C] In conventional farming, land is plowed, disked, or harrowed to prepare the seedbed, seed is drilled into the soil with a planter, and row crops are cultivated with a mechanical cultivator two or three times to control weeds. [D] With minimum tillage, farmers simply drill seeds directly into the soil. The only tillage is a one-time disturbance in a narrow band of soil where the seeds are inserted, leaving the remainder of the soil undisturbed, covered by crop residues and thus resistant to both water and wind erosion.
Question: These methods differ from traditional farming practices.
Answer: C

Context: Within the ocean, the production of limestone, in the form of calcium carbonate skeletons or shells, also reduces atmospheric carbon dioxide. [A] However, when deposits of limestone become exposed and weathered on land or are recycled in the sea, carbon dioxide is released back into the atmosphere. [B] What is not well understood is how much carbon dioxide resides in the sea and at what rate it is taken up and recycled. [C] Relatively new research has also discovered beneath the sea a new and potentially significant threat to skyrocketing Earth temperatures: gas hydrates. [D] Gas hydrates are a solid, crystalline form of water, like ice, except that they contain additional gas, typically methane, and are often found stored in ocean sediments.
Question: Nor is carbon dioxide the only gaseous substance in the ocean that may affect climate.
Answer: C

Context: [A] Some meteorites consist of rocky material and, accordingly, are called stony meteorites. [B] Others are metallic and have been designated iron meteorites even though they contain lesser amounts of elements other than iron. [C] Still others consist of mixtures of rocky and metallic material and thus are called stony-iron meteorites. [D] Meteors come in all sizes, from small particles to the small planets known as asteroids; no asteroid, however, has struck Earth during recorded human history.
Question: Several varieties of meteorites have been observed.
Answer: A

Context: [A] If avoidance of inbreeding is the point of dispersing, then one might expect as many female ground squirrels as males to travel 150 meters from their natal burrow. [B] In fact females do not disperse as far as males, perhaps because the costs and benefits of dispersal differ for the two sexes. [C] It has been suggested that the reproductive success of female Belding’s ground squirrels depends on their possession of a territory in which to rear their young. [D] Female ground squirrels that remain near their birthplace enjoy assistance from their mothers in the defense of their burrows against rival females.
Question: However, inbreeding can be avoided without both males and their female relatives dispersing the same distance.
Answer: B

Context: In a work published in 1972, Professor Colin Renfrew approached the problem from a different viewpoint. [A] He argued that the scanty available evidence for invasion or immigration from Anatolia into Greece in the early Bronze Age (about 3300-2200 B.C.E.) showed that, at most, such incursion was limited, and that it could not be regarded as responsible for the transformation of society there. [B] Trade, though clearly documented, was also an inadequate explanation in itself. [C] To understand the major changes in social organization and complexity that took place, it was necessary, said Renfrew, to determine the impact that new variables emerging in the early Bronze Age may have had on every interrelated aspect of the local social system. [D] The two new major developments he considered were changes in the subsistence economy and the introduction of bronze metallurgy.
Question: Instead, Renfrew emphasized the complex internal dynamics of change.
Answer: C

Context: Geoarchaeological analyses involve many different kinds of questions and techniques. [A] In the Egyptian Delta region, for example, many of the earliest communities were built on large sand-and-gravel mounds created by the Nile River as it deposited the sediments it carried. [B] But many of these communities have been buried under many meters of sediments from numerous ancient floods since that time and by other factors as well. [C] Moreover, the streams feeding into the Nile River in the delta have changed course many times, leaving a maze of crisscrossed buried river channels. [D] Finding these buried sand-and gravel mounds and the archaeological sites on them often requires complex geological analyses involving special digging, satellite image analysis, and many other techniques.
Question: Such a variety of methods are especially important at sites that are no longer visible on the surface.
Answer: A

Context: Over a period of several hundred years, Venice developed an elaborate system of cisterns and gome-the gutters or pipes that carried rainwater to the cisterns and that, for a single cistern, might extend over an area of several streets. [A] Wealthy households had their own cisterns. [B] In less affluent areas of the city, cisterns were often owned and maintained by neighborhood groups. [C] In crowded parts of the city where landlords offered small house for rent, one or two cisterns were provided for each street. [D] A network of public cisterns paralleled these private and semiprivate arrangements. Every public square in the city had a cistern to serve the poorest venetians.
Question: The complexity of the cistern system was social as well as physical.
Answer: A

Context: Predation was an astonishing 19 percent of the frogs per night in the smallest chorus and a substantial 1.5 percent per night even in the largest chorus. [A] When a male frog shifts from a simple whine to a whine-chuck call, it increases its risk of attracting a female, but it simultaneously increases its risk of attracting a predator. [B] In small choruses, the competition from other males for females is relatively small, and the risk of predation is relatively large. [C] Under these conditions it is apparently advantageous for a male tungara frog to give simple whines. [D] However, as chorus size increases, competition with other males also increases while the risk of predation falls.
Question: Predation, therefore, is a risk in choruses of all sizes, but the risk varies depending on the type of call used.
Answer: A

Context: Renfrew has studies two circumscribed areas, the Scottish islands of Arran and Rousay, to examine this hypothesis more closely. [A] He found that a division of the arable land into territories, each containing one megalith, results in units that correspond in size to the individual farming communities of recent times in the same area. [B] Each unit supported between 10 and 50 people. [C] The labor needed to put up a megalith would probably be beyond the capabilities of a community this size. [D] But Renfrew argues that the cooperation of other communities could be secured by some form of recognized social incentive—perhaps a period of feasting at which communal building was one of several activities.
Question: So it might seem that megaliths could not have been used by an individual community to mark its land.
Answer: D

Context: We know, or think we know, that social groups are good. [A] Wolves are better predators when they hunt in packs, and pigeons escape from falcons far more often when feeding in flocks.[B] Group building projects the dams beavers build to block a body of water that provides them with relative safety from predators and the lodges they build for shelter, for instance, can provide a high level of protection and comfort.. [C] Why, then, are social species so very rare?[D] In fact, living socially presents inevitable problems that transcend habitat needs so that only when these costs are offset by corresponding benefits is group living a plus.
Question: The engineering of structures of such size and complexity is unknown among solitary animals.
Answer: C

Context: This was the Modern movement, which was based on the idea that buildings and cities should be designed and run like machines.[A] Equally important to the Modernists was that urban design should not simply reflect dominant social and cultural values but, rather, help to create a new moral and social order.[B] The movement's best-known advocate was Le Corbusier, a Paris-based Swiss who provided the inspiration for technocratic urban design.[C] Modernist buildings sought to dramatize technology, exploit industrial production techniques, and use modern materials and unembellished, functional design. Le Corbusier's ideal city featured linear clusters of high-density, medium-rise apartment blocks, elevated on stilts and segregated from industrial districts; high-rise tower office blocks; and transportation routesall separated by broad expanses of public open space.[D]
Question: This mechanical analogy was a significant departure from earlier attitudes that emphasized the civilizing influence of cities and their buildings.
Answer: A

Context: These several confliction factors—the need to modify palace and capital arrangements but the difficulty of doing so, the wish to enjoy grandeur but the reluctance to settle for a single, immobile court—all became evident by the mid-seventh century. [A] Change did come, but slowly, and in the end a compromise system was devised. [B] Traditional shrines of Shinto, the native religion of Japan, and many residential buildings continued to be built in the rottable, replaceable style that accommodated religious concerns and taboos, while city gates, major government buildings, and Buddhist temples were built in the continental fashion that met the need for permanence and grandeur. [C] Moreover, the wish of rulers to maintain multiple palaces fit with the custom of certain continental regimes that maintained summer palaces or other regional capitals where rulers could periodically reside on a temporary basis. [D] 
Question: Such temporary residences might have enabled Japanese rulers to better control the people living far from the main capital.
Answer: D

Context: Nearly five billion years ago, some external influence, such as a shock wave traveling from a catastrophic explosion (supernova), may have triggered the collapse of this huge cloud of gases and minute grains of heavier elements, causing the cloud to begin to slowly contract due to the gravitational interactions among its particles. [A] As this slowly spiraling nebula contracted, it rotated faster and faster for the same reason ice-skaters do when they draw their arms toward their bodies. [B] Eventually, the inward pull of gravity came into balance with the outward force caused by the rotational motion of the nebula. [C] By this time the once vast cloud had assumed a flat disk shape with a large concentration of material at its center, called the protosun (pre-Sun). [D] Astronomers are fairly confident that the nebular cloud formed a disk because similar structures have been detected around other stars.
Question: In other words, as the outer parts of a rotating mass are pulled inward, the speed of rotation increases.
Answer: B

Context: There are both great similarities and considerable diversity in the ecosystems that evolved on the islands of Oceania in and around the Pacific Ocean. [A] The islands, such as New Zealand, that were originally parts of continents still carry some small plant and animal remnants of their earlier biota (animal and plant life), and they also have been extensively modified by evolution, adaptation, and the arrival of new species. [B] By contrast, the other islands, which emerged via geological processes such as volcanism, possessed no terrestrial life, but over long periods, winds, ocean currents, and the feet, feathers, and digestive tracts of birds brought the seeds of plants and a few species of animals. [C] Only those species with ways of spreading to these islands were able to undertake the long journeys, and the various factors at play resulted in diverse combinations of new colonists on the islands. One estimate is that the distribution of plants was 75 percent by birds, 23 percent by floating, and only 2 percent by wind. [D]
Question: When varied ecosystems are present, they can be explained as resulting in part from the process that formed the islands.
Answer: A

Context: Not all of the Burgess animals had eyes. However, some did. (Gross features location, size, and hemispheric shape are responsible for the designation of some structures as eyes).[A] The reconstructed eyes of these Burgess animals look superficially like eyes of some living crustaceans, particularly those of shrimp and crabs whose eyes are mounted on stalks that improve the range of vision by raising the eyes above the surface of the head. [B] The eyes of some Burgess organisms sat on stalks; those of others were on or a part of the body surface. [C] One animal, Opabinia, had five eyes: two lateral pairs and a single medial eye; at least one of the lateral pairs had stalks that could have been movable. [D] And some trilobite-like animals in the Burgess Shale had faceted eyes much like those of later fossil trilobites.
Question: Molaria spinifera and H. optata, both of which lived in water levels beyond the reach of light, fit into this category.
Answer: B

Context: These lighter materials, such as the rocks we call granites, formed a layer of continental crust about 35 kilometers thick. [A] Relative to Earth as a whole, this is as thin as an eggshell.[B] Seafloor crust is even thinner, at about 7 kilometers; thus, even continental crust reaches only about 1/200th of the way to Earth's core.[C] Much of the early continental crust has remained on Earth's surface to the present day.[D]
Question: Even some of its oldest portions as old as 3.8 billion years can still be found in parts of Canada, Australia, South Africa, and Greenland.
Answer: D

Context: The most characteristic Near Eastern Bronze Age civilizations, those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were located in river valleys, were based on the extensive exploitation of agriculture, and supported large populations. [A] Bronze was a valuable commodity in these civilizations, the copper and tin needed for its manufacture did not exist in river valleys and had to be imported. [B] Bronze was therefore used mainly for luxury items, such as jewelry or weapons, not for everyday domestic items, which were made from pottery, animal products, wood, and stone. [C] In particular, bronze was not used for farming tools. [D] Thus, early civilizations based on large-scale agriculture, such as those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were feasible only in soils that could be worked by wooden plows pulled by people or draft animals such as oxen.
Question: This significantly limited the availability of bronze.
Answer: B

Context: Europe’s overall population growth from 1050 to 1300 had been primarily due to an increase in the number of rural folk. [A] But as economic forces made agrarian life more perilous around 1300, hard-pressed farmers and their families began to migrate to the cities in large number in search of work. [B] Many cities doubled in size, and some even tripled, over the course of just one or two generations. [C] Few were capable of absorbing such large numbers of people. [D]
Question: Farms, villages, and entire regions were abandoned.
Answer: B

Context: The accidental introduction of organisms to new areas may have major pest implications. [A] The South African bronze butterfly, the larva (immature insect forms) of which feed on buds and other parts of geraniums and similar flowers, was accidentally introduced into the Balearic Islands via imported geraniums. [B] In its native South Africa, the distribution and abundance of the butterfly are affected in part by a native wasp that parasitizes (feeds on) the larvae. [C] In the absence of the parasite wasp on the Balearic Islands off the coast of Spain, the butterfly has now spread to mainland Spain where its rapid spread has been accentuated by trade in garden plants and modem transport. [D] The species has become a major pest due to the lack of a natural predator and is now causing great problems for the horticultural industry in Spain.
Question: Its presence there helps control the bronze butterfly population.
Answer: C

Context: [A] The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for transport and communications, even before the unification of Egypt. [B] The region probably acted as a conduit for much, if not all, of the river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. [C] Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south. [D] In short, therefore, the site of Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.
Question: While considerations of political power and ease of administration were decisive in choosing the location of the new capital, the site clearly had other advantages.
Answer: A

Context: [A] Even more important were the gains in urban sanitation, as well as measures such as inspection of housing. [B] Reformers, including enlightened doctors, began to study the causes of high death rates and to urge remediation. Even before the discovery of germs, beliefs that disease spread by “miasmas”（noxious forms of bad air) prompted attention to sewers and open garbage. Edwin Chadwick led an exemplary urban crusade for underground sewers in England in the 1830s. [C] Gradually, public health provisions began to cut into customary urban mortality rates. [D] By 1900, in some parts of Western Europe life expectancy in the cities began to surpass that of the rural areas.
Question: Such individual efforts had substantial, concrete effects on society.
Answer: C

Context: In some spiritual traditions, landscapes such as gardens or deserts were treated as abstract emblems of spiritual states such as innocence or despair. [A] Rather than symbolic landscapes, as in the Judeo-Christian tradition, Greek sacred groves operated as literal homes of the gods.[B] Instead of being confined to prehistory or celestial space, spiritual parkscapes were present within the existing cultural terrain.[C] One could not visit a symbol of peace and serenity, but one could experience these qualities in a sacred grove.[D]
Question: This, however, was not the Greek attitude.
Answer: A

Context: [A] The adoption of a regional perspective in explaining the Chaco Phenomenon was based in part on the discovery of formal trails connecting many of the great houses in Chaco, as well as linking the canyon to smaller great houses located throughout the San Juan basin, the latter are referred to as Chaco “outliers.” [B] These trails are densest around the concentration of great houses in the center, and the canyon itself is roughly at the center of the basin. [C] Consequently, the canyon occupies the geographical and social center of the network formed by the connecting trails. [D] The current consensus view is that religion provides the fundamental explanation for this centrifugal pattern.
Question: Scholars have attempted to find a reason for this weblike arrangement of great houses around a central canyon.
Answer: D

Context: From fossil evidence alone the question of whether or not dinosaurs cared for their young is very difficult to answer. [A] Because behaviors are not preserved in the fossil record, we can only make inferences from indirect evidence.[B] Parental care can be divided into two types of behavior: prehatching (building nests and incubating eggs—for example, sitting on top of them so as to warm the eggs and encourage hatching) and posthatching (feeding the young and guarding the nests). [C] Most of our evidence comes from alleged dinosaur rookeries (places where nests are built). [D] Several have been excavated in eastern Montana, where a large concentration of dinosaur nests was found at a place now called Egg Mountain. Most of these probably belonged to the hadrosaur Maiasaura.
Question: Evidence of the former is easier to find than that of the latter.
Answer: C

Context: [A] The commercial revolution constructed the economic basis as well for a new kind of town or city, an urban center that above all serviced trade and was home to the crafts and occupational specializations that went along with commercial development. [B] The urban locations of earlier times commonly drew trade simply because their populations had included a privileged elite of potential consumers. [C] Such towns had arisen in the first place as political and religious centers of the society, they attracted population because power and influence resides there and access to position and wealth could be gained through service to the royal or priestly leadership. [D]
Question: It was significantly different from the typical centers that existed before the commercial revolution.
Answer: B

Context: [A] The social context for science in Europe in the sixteenth and seventeenth centuries had changed in several dramatic ways from the Middle Ages (roughly, 500 C.E. to the 1400s C.E.). [B] Advances in military technology, the European voyages of exploration, and contact with the New World altered the context in which the Scientific Revolution unfolded. The geographical discovery of the Americas generally undermined the closed Eurocentric cosmos of the later Middle Ages, and the science of geography provided a stimulus of its own to the Scientific Revolution. [C] With an emphasis on observational reports and practical experience, new geographical discoveries challenged accepted knowledge. Cartography (mapmaking) thus provided exemplary new ways of learning about the world in general, ways self-evidently superior to mastering established doctrines from dusty books. [D] Many of the scientists of the Scientific Revolution seem to have been involved in one fashion or another with geography or cartography.
Question: Given the advantages these new approaches offered, it is hardly surprising that sciences associated with exploration attracted great intellectual interest.
Answer: D

Context: About 40 percent of incoming solar radiation is simply reflected, unchanged, back into space by the clouds, the sea, and other surfaces. [A] For any planetary body, the percentage of incoming radiation that is reflected is called the “albedo.” [B] Each different material has a characteristic reflectivity. [C] For example, ice is more reflectant than rocks or pavement; water is more highly reflectant than vegetation, and forested land reflects light differently than agricultural land. [D] Thus, if large expanses of land are converted from forest to plowed land, or from forest to city, the actual reflectivity of Earth’s surface, and hence its albedo, may be altered. Any change in albedo will, of course, have an effect on Earth’s energy budget.
Question: How reflective a material is depends on how light or dark it is, among other things.
Answer: C

Context: Dutch publishers had an advantage over many other publishers around Europe because the Netherlands’ highly decentralized political system made its censorship laws very difficult to enforce. [A] Throughout Europe in the seventeenth century, governments began recognizing the revolutionary potential of the free press and began requiring licenses of newspapers—to control who was able to publish news. [B] Another tactic, in France and elsewhere on the continent from the 1630s onward, was for governments to sponsor official newspapers.[C] These state publications met the increasing demand for news but always supported the government's views of the events of the day. [D]
Question: And even when it was possible to apply laws limiting speech, authorities were reluctant to do so because of the growing economic importance of the commercial book market.
Answer: A

Context: One innovation was a new plow, with a curved attachment (moldboard) to turn over wet, heavy soils, and a knife (or coulter) in front of the blade to allow a deeper and easier cut.[A] This more complex plow replaced the simpler “scratch” plow that merely made a shallow, straight furrow in the ground. [B] In the lands around the Mediterranean, with light rains and mild winters, this had been fine, but in the wetter terrain north and west of the Danube and the Alps, such a plow left much to be desired, and it is to be wondered if it was used at all. [C] Cleared lands would more likely have been worked by hand tilling, with little direct help from animals, and the vast forests natural to Northern Europe remained either untouched, or perhaps cleared in small sections by fire, and the land probably used only so long as the ash-enriched soil yielded good crops and then abandoned for some other similarly cleared field.[D] Such a pattern of agriculture and settlement was no basis for sustained cultural or economic life.
Question: In fact, it sliced the ground so thoroughly that fields could be planted after only one plowing rather than the two needed before.
Answer: A

Context: [A] Sound frequencies-or pitch-can also convey information about the calling male because the vocal apparatus grows larger as the frog grows older. [B] In some frogs, the pitch of individual sounds varies with so that older and larger males give lower-pitched calls. [C] Sound pitch if affected by temperature; small males can mimic the lower pitch of larger, older males by calling from colder locations. [D] Finally, the length of time that an individual can afford to spend calling is a good indicator of his health.
Question: But a frog's age is not the only influence on the pitch of a frog's call.
Answer: C

Context: Young chaffinches normally learn only chaffinch song, though Thorpe found they could be trained to sing the song of a tree pipit (another type of bird), which is very similar to that of their own species. [A] In general, however, the constraints on learning which birds have ensure that they only learn songs appropriate to the species to which they themselves belong. [B] These constraints may be in their brain’s circuitry, the young bird hatching with a rough idea of the sounds that it should copy. [C] The crude song of a bird reared in isolation gives some clues as to what this rough idea may be: the length, the frequency range and the breaking up into notes are all aspects of chaffinch song shared between normal birds and those reared in isolation. [D] In other cases the constraints are more social, young birds only being prepared to learn from individuals with whom they have social interactions.
Question: Are these constraints genetic, environmental, or both?
Answer: B

Context: Adaptations to the regular change of seasons in the temperate and polar regions may be relatively simple. For example, many seeds require a period of stratification, exposure to low temperatures for some minimum period, before they will germinate. [A] This is a simple adaptation to ensure that germination occurs following the winter conditions rather than immediately prior to their onset. [B] In contrast, unfavorable conditions that occur unpredictably pose considerable problems for organisms. [C] In fact, unpredictability is probably a greater problem than is the severity of the unfavorable period. [D] How can organisms cope with the unpredictable onset of good or poor conditions?
Question: Such adaptations to predictable conditions can also be made by animals, such as by hibernating during the coldest months.
Answer: B

Context: Allying himself with other wealthy capitalists, he proceeded methodically to buy out competing refineries. [A] In 1870, he formed the Standard Oil Company of Ohio, which in a few years had acquired twenty of the twenty-five refineries in Cleveland, as well as plants in Pittsburgh, Philadelphia, New York, and Baltimore. [B] He built his own barrel factories, warehouses, and pipelines. [C] Standard Oil owned its own railroad freight cars and developed its own marketing organization. [D] By the 1880s, Rockefeller had established such dominance within the petroleum industry that to much of the nation he served as a leading symbol of monopoly.
Question: In addition to expanding horizontally, Rockefeller’s company expanded vertically as well.
Answer: B

Context: Large brain size does not always mean that an animal is highly intelligent. Brain size is necessarily associated with overall body size, with large animals having large brains and small animals having small brains. [A] However, it is still necessary for there to be some minimum amount of circuitry (brain cells and processes) present for a species to have the potential to be highly intelligent, whatever way the term intelligence is defined. [B] A measure of relative brain size that has been applied to a variety of species is the encephalization quotient (EQ), the radio of brain mass to body size. [C] The EQ is calculated by measuring the relative size of different body parts over a wide range of species. [D] An EQ of 1.0 means that the brain is exactly the size one would expect for an animal of a particular size, an EQ higher than 1.0 means that a species is relatively brainy.
Question: This requirement suggests that having a brain that is large relative to an animal's size might be a clue to greater intelligence.
Answer: B

Context: About 10,000 years ago, after nearly 4 million years of human evolution and over 100,000 years of successful foraging for food, human beings, although isolated, nearly simultaneously developed a subsistence strategy that involved domesticated plants and animals. Why? [A] Some scholars seek a single, universal explanation that would be valid for all cases of domestication. [B] Thus, it has been argued that domestication is the outcome of population pressure, as the increasing hunting-and-gathering human population overwhelmed the existing food resources. [C] Others point to climate change or famine, as the post-glacial climate got drier. [D] Increasing archaeological research has made it clear, however, that the evidence in favor of any single-cause, universally applicable explanation is not strong.
Question: Scholars have developed a number of hypotheses to explain the historical origins of agriculture.
Answer: A

Context: Rain forests are wet by definition. [A]But in some there is a dry season, and even when there is not, it doesn't rain all the time.[B]Thus the forest floor may be moist, but the topmost leaves of the canopy are far above it and are exposed to the fiercest sun. [C]So the uppermost leaves must resist desiccation (drying out). [D]Yet from time to time, and in due season every day, they must also endure tremendous downpours.
Question: As a result, the topmost level of a rainforest can be desert-like.
Answer: C

Context: If strong cooling lasted a year after the formation of the aerosols, it would have been the death of tropical species unable to adapt to such a volcanic winter. [A] However，a long period of strong volcanic activity (again，remember thousands of Krakatoas) would at the same time have added a substantial amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, reinforcing the greenhouse effect. [B] This would gradually warm things up，ending the extended cold snap and producing global warming together with geographic shifts of humid and arid (dry) zones.[C] Certainly things would change to upset living conditions, leading to the extinction of some species while others would profit, if only from the disappearance of predators. [D]
Question: Thus, ecosystems following periods of extensive volcanic activity necessarily had different combinations of species than earlier ecosystems did.
Answer: C

Context: If strong cooling lasted a year after the formation of the aerosols, it would have been the death of tropical species unable to adapt to such a volcanic winter. [A] However，a long period of strong volcanic activity (again，remember thousands of Krakatoas) would at the same time have added a substantial amount of carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, reinforcing the greenhouse effect. [B] This would gradually warm things up，ending the extended cold snap and producing global warming together with geographic shifts of humid and arid (dry) zones.[C] Certainly things would change to upset living conditions, leading to the extinction of some species while others would profit, if only from the disappearance of predators. [D]
Question: Thus, ecosystems following periods of extensive volcanic activity necessarily had different combinations of species than earlier ecosystems did.
Answer: D

Context: Evolution is one such process, and geologist Charles Lyell (1797-1875) recognized this. [A] By comparing the amount of evolution exhibited by marine mollusks then, Lyell estimated that 80 million years had elapsed since the beginning of the Tertiary Period. He came astonishingly close to the mark, since it was actually about 65 million years. [B] However, for older sequence of evolutionary development, estimates based on parts in the fossil record. [C] Rates of evolution for many orders of plants and animals were not well understood. [D]
Question: More fundamentally, Lyell’s evolutionary approach is intrinsically limited because Earth existed long before life and evolution began.
Answer: D

Context: Public interest was soon rekindled when early filmmakers discovered that movies could be used to tell story. [A] In France, Alice Guy-Blache produced The Cabbage Fairy, a one-minute film about a fairy who produces children in a Cabbage patch, and exhibited it at the Paris International Exhibition in 1896. [B] Guy-Blache went on to found her own studio in America. [C] Better known is the work of a fellow French filmmaker and magician, Georges Melies. [D] In 1902 Melies produced a science-fiction film that was the great-great-grandfather of Star Wars and Star Trek; it was called A Trip to the Moon.
Question: Although she directed hundreds of short films and produced hundreds more over the course of her career, she has largely been forgotten.
Answer: C

Context: The Akkadians conquered the Sumerians around the middle of the third millennium B.C.E, and they took over the various cuneiform signs used for writing Sumerian and gave them sound and word values that fit their own language. [A] The Babylonians and Assyrians did the same, and so did peoples in Syria and Asia Minor. [B] The literature of the Sumerians was treasured throughout the Near East, and long after Sumerian ceased to be spoken, the Babylonians and Assyrians and others kept it alive as a literary language, the way Europeans kept Latin alive after the fall of Rome. [C] For the scribes of these non-Sumerian languages, training was doubly demanding since they had to know the values of the various cuneiform signs for Sumerian as well as for their own language. [D]
Question: However, the Sumerian language did not entirely disappear.
Answer: B

Context: Fertilizers partially restore plant nutrients lost by erosion, crop harvesting and leaching. [A] Farmers can use either organic fertilizer from plant and animal materials or commercial inorganic fertilizer produced from various minerals. [B] Three basic types of organic fertilizer are animal manure, green manure, and compost. [C] Animal manure includes the waste matter of cattle, horses, poultry, and other farm animals. [D] It improves soil structure, adds organic, nitrogen, and stimulates beneficial soil bacteria and fungi.
Question: Thus, they help keep farmland productive over the long term.
Answer: A

Context: Added to these was the characteristic American preference both for independent living, usually associated with having an individual, free-standing home for one’s family, and for rural living. [A] Economics affected urbanization in two ways. First, economic considerations influenced location decisions for business and industry, which often preempted choice sites. [B] Second, industrial growth generated higher incomes for large segments of the population, which in turn provided more money for larger homes and commuter transportation. [C] Related to economics (since costs to individuals always played a role) were improvements in transportation, from the first horse-drawn buses of the 1820s to electrified street railways at the end of the century. [D] Each transport innovation extended the distance that a person could reasonably travel as a commuter or shopper, while constant system improvements and increased ridership lessened costs.
Question: As a result, many locations that would have been ideal for housing ---or for urban parks or other public spaces--- were unavailable for such use.
Answer: B

Context: Europe’s overall population growth from 1050 to 1300 had been primarily due to an increase in the number of rural folk. [A] But as economic forces made agrarian life more perilous around 1300, hard-pressed farmers and their families began to migrate to the cities in large number in search of work. [B] Many cities doubled in size, and some even tripled, over the course of just one or two generations. [C] Few were capable of absorbing such large numbers of people. [D]
Question: Farms, villages, and entire regions were abandoned.
Answer: B

Context: Alexander Du Toit, a South African geologist was one of Wegener’s ardent supporters. [A] He noted that fossils of the Permian freshwater reptile “Mesosaurus” occur in rocks of the same age in both Brazil and South Africa. [B] Because the physiology of freshwater and marine animals is completely different, it is hard to imagine how a freshwater reptile could have swum across the Atlantic Ocean and then found a freshwater environment nearly identical to its former habitat. [C] Furthermore, if Mesosaurus could have swum across the ocean, its fossil remains should occur in other localities besides Brazil and South Africa. [D] It is more logical to assume that Mesosaurus lived in lakes in what are now adjacent areas of South America and Africa but were then united in a single continent.
Question: In addition to supplying new geological evidence for continental drift, he crafted convincing arguments based on ancient life forms.
Answer: A

Context: Other sea creatures have both light-sensing and light-producing organs. These creatures are thought to use bioluminescence as a form of communication or as a means of identifying an appropriate mate. [A] In the lantern fish, the pattern of photophores distinguishes one species from another. [B] In other fish, bioluminescence may help to differentiate males from females. [C] The squid uses light as a means of camouflage. [D] By producing light from the photophores on its underside, the squid can match light form above and become nearly invisible to predators looking up from below.
Question: Yet, certain species use bioluminescence for exactly the opposite purpose—to blend in with surroundings and become less identifiable.
Answer: C

Context: Coordinated social interactions tend to be week when a colony is first forming, but true colonies provide extra benefits. [A] Synchronized nesting, for example, produces abundance of eggs and chicks that exceeds the daily needs of local predators. [B] Additionally, colonial neighbors can improve their foraging by watching others. [C] This behavior in especially valuable when the offsite food supplies are restricted or variable in location, as are swarms of aerial insects harvested by swallows. [D] The colonies American cliff swallows, for example, serve as information centers from which unsuccessful individual birds follow successful neighbors to good feeding sites.
Question: The overall survival of the nest generation is thus enhanced.
Answer: B

Context: [A] The region of Memphis must have also served as an important node for transport and communications, even before the unification of Egypt. [B] The region probably acted as a conduit for much, if not all, of the river-based trade between northern and southern Egypt. [C] Moreover, commodities (such as wine, precious oils, and metals) imported from the Near East by the royal courts of predynastic Upper Egypt would have been channeled through the Memphis region on their way south. [D] In short, therefor, the site Memphis offered the rulers of the Early Dynastic Period an ideal location for controlling internal trade within their realm, an essential requirement for a state-directed economy that depended on the movement of goods.
Question: While considerations of political power and ease of administration were decisive in choosing the location of the new capital, the site clearly had other advantages.
Answer: A

Context: With a significant amount of internal heat, Venus may continue to be geologically active with volcanoes, rifting, and folding. [A] However, it lacks any sign of a hydrologic system (water circulation and distribution): there are no streams, lakes, oceans, or glaciers. [B] Space probes suggest that Venus may have started with as much water as Earth, but it was unable to keep its water in liquid form. [C] Because Venus receives more heat from the Sun, water released from the interior evaporated and rose to the upper atmosphere where the Sun’s ultraviolet rays broke the molecules apart. [D] Much of the freed hydrogen escaped into space, and Venus lost its water.
Question: Venus may not have always been this way.
Answer: B

Context: On one hand, mobility can be seen as socially useful because it promotes both individual well-being and the quality of job matches. [A] Moreover, the greater the number of workers and employers “in the market” at any given time, the more flexibility an economy has in making job matches that best adapt to a changing environment. [B] Indeed, when focusing on this aspect of job mobility, economists have long worried whether economies have enough mobility. [C] On the other hand, lower mobility costs (and therefore greater mobility) among workers may well serve to reduce the incentives of their employers to provide job training. [D] Whether the presence of job changing costs is a social boon or bane, these costs and the mobility associated with them are factors with which all employers must contend.
Question: According to this view, greater mobility could result in a less skilled workforce.
Answer: D

Context: To early ethologists, the major driving force in behavior was instinct, behaviors that are inherited and unchangeable. [A] Moths move towards light because they inherit the mechanism to so respond to light. [B] Although dogs have more options available to them, they bark at strangers for much the same reasons. [C] The comparative behaviorists disagreed: learning and rewards are more important factors than instinct in animal behavior. [D] Geese are not born with the ability to retrieve lost eggs when they roll out the nest, they learn to do so.
Question: This view is supported by the behavior of insects as well as animals.
Answer: A

Context: Cash gave farmers choices they did not enjoy when they traded with neighbors alone. [A] Beyond opening up access to a range of products that could not be produced locally, it freed them from the web of mutual indebtedness and allowed more choices in the selection of trading partners. [B] In other words, the cash economy allowed producers to seek the best bargains in that wider, impersonal market of which the export of agricultural surpluses formed the principal part. [C] Of course, few in this age would have welcomed total release from the support and obligations that local trade conferred. [D]
Question: Consequently, most farmers who participated in the long distance cash economy continued to deal with local merchants through the system of trade credit.
Answer: D

Context: Though the hatchlings position themselves geomagnetically as soon as they leave the nest and appear to be able to use that position as a reference point, they will not follow it automatically if other cues, such as light and sound, are available. [A] Hatchlings find their geomagnetic compass useful only after they have already been able to determine the direction they should swim. [B] A simple directional compass—one that always sent the turtles westward, for instance—would be useless if the open sea lay in some other direction. [C] Therefore, a magnetic compass does not so much tell a hatchling turtle which way to go as keep it on course once it has determined the direction it should swim from some other cue. [D]
Question: This preference for other cues points to the special role of the geomagnetic compass in hatchling navigation.
Answer: A

Context: Flying animals move through air that is less dense and less viscous than water, so why does flying cost more than swimming? First, most flying animals move much faster than a swimmer in order to produce enough lift (the upward force necessary to overcome gravity). [A]This higher speed increases the drag that a flyer must overcome. [B]Furthermore, a flyer has an extra source of drag that a swimmer does not have: the extra drag that comes from lift production. [C]In a way, the extra drag represents the cost of supporting the flyer’s weight in air. [D]
Question: Thus, the need to overcome resistance to fast forward motion plus the muscular effort needed just to keep from falling makes flying more energy intensive than swimming.
Answer: D

Context: [A]The Mexican muralist movement is undoubtedly one of the most important manifestations of twentieth-century Mexican culture. [B]Its impact elsewhere in the region, as well as in the United States and Europe, has been enormous. [C]The work of Rivera, Orozco, and Siqueiros triggered a homegrown muralist movement in the United States in cities like New York City, Detroit, Los Angeles, and San Francisco. [D]The influence of the Mexicans on the modern Spanish painter Picasso’s first mural and almost his only major explicitly propagandist work of art—his famous Guemica of 1937—is unmistakable even though the artist himself would have derived it.
Question: However, its influence was not limited to Mexico itself.
Answer: B

Context: The Incans ruled a vast empire in western South America when the Spaniards encountered them in the sixteenth century. [A]Although the Incas had no writing system of their own, historical information about Incas is available to researchers because early Spaniards wrote documents about them. [B]However, there are drawbacks to use the written record. [C]First, the Spanish writers were describing activities and institutions that were very different from their own, but they often described Inca culture in terms of their own society. [D]As an example, consider the list of kings given by the Incas.
Question: Official accounts, legal papers, and letters written during that period provide a wealth of information about the Incan empire and the Incas' way of life.
Answer: B

Context: For years, scholars argued that the practices of cultivation and animal domestication were invented in one or two locations on Earth and then diffused from those centers of innovation. [A] Genetic studies are now showing that many different groups of people in many different places around the globe learned independently to create especially useful plants and animals through selective breeding. [B] Probably both independent invention and diffusion played a role in agricultural innovation. [C] Sometimes the ideas of domestication and cultivation were relayed to new places. In other cases the farmers or herders themselves moved into new zones, taking agriculture or improvements such as new tools or new methods or new plants and animals with them. [D]
Question: Among the many places that are now known to be centers of independent domestication are Mesopotamia, Central China, and Mesoamerica.
Answer: B

Context: Furthermore, Anglo-American exporters of tobacco and rice—the chief commodities affected by enumeration—had their burdens reduced by two significant concessions.[A] First, Parliament gave tobacco growers a monopoly over the British market by excluding foreign tobacco, even though this hurt British consumers.[B] (Rice planters enjoyed a natural monopoly because they had no competitors.)[C] Second, Parliament tried to minimize the added cost of landing tobacco and rice in Britain (where customs officials collected duties on both) by refunding the duties on all tobacco and rice that the colonists later shipped to other countries. [D]
Question: About 85 percent of all North American tobacco and rice was eventually reexported and sold outside the British Empire.
Answer: D

Context: The technological and managerial innovations of Thomas Alva Edison (the inventor of electricity) and the industrial leaders Andrew Carnegie (iron and steel) and John D. Rockefeller (oil) proved readily adaptable throughout United States industry, spurring marvels of productivity. [A] Late-nineteenth-century industrialists often discovered that their factories produced more goods than the market could absorb. [B] This was particular true in two kinds of businesses: those that manufactured devices for individual use, such as sewing machines and farm implements, and those that mass-produced consumer goods, such as matches, flour, soap, canned foods, and processed meats. [C] Not surprisingly, these industries were trailblazers in developing advertising and marketing techniques. [D] Strategies for encouraging consumer demand and for differentiating one product from another were an important component of the American post-Civil War industrial transformation.
Question: Edison's laboratory in Menlo Park, New Jersey, even became a model for the industrial research laboratories established by other corporations.
Answer: A

Context: Most species of seaweed are benthic (living on the seafloor); they grow on rock, sand, mud, and coral on the sea bottom. Other species live on other organisms and as part of fouling communities (plants and animals that live on pilings, boat bottoms, and other artificial surfaces). [A] Some seaweeds attach to very specific surfaces, whereas other seaweeds are rather nonselective. In general, seaweeds inhabit about 2 percent of the seafloor. [B] The presence of benthic seaweeds defines the inner continental shelf, where the marine community largely depends on the food and protection that seaweeds provide. [C] Life on the outer continental shelf and in the deep sea is quite different in the absence of seaweeds. [D] The distinction between the inner and outer shelves is based on the compensation depth of algae.
Question: They are most prevalent on the part of the sea bottom known as the continental shelf.
Answer: B

Context: Societies throughout history have invested their objects with styles that have profound and complex meanings and effects. [A] In the case of the Maya and every other early civilization, rulers used particular symbols and styles as mechanisms through which they portrayed, communicated, and implemented their power. [B] In all societies, styles fix social meaning and are powerful ways in which social groups define and construct their culture. [C] Styles of objects, language, and personal behavior identity people in terms of gender, age group, ethnic group, socioeconomic class, and in many other important ways. [D] Some researchers, for example, have argued that a particular kind of pottery, called Ramey incised (which is incised with figures of eyes, fish, arrows, and abstract objects and was used by the people in the area of present-day Missouri and Illinois at about A.D 900), was primarily used to distribute food but was also used to communicate the idea that the society’s elite, for whom the pots were made, were mediators of cosmic forces.
Question: Maya rulers, for example, used symbols on their war banners to communicate that they had great power because of the support of patron gods.
Answer: B

Context: Further evidence that the Yucatan crater is the right one comes from the distribution of small glassy spheres that formed when the molten impact ejecta solidified as it rained back to Earth. [A] More of these glassy spheres are found in regions near the crater, and careful study of their distribution suggests that the impactor crashed to Earth at a slight angle. [B] These pieces of once molten rock are evidence of an explosion powerful enough to instantly melt bedrock and propel it far from its origin. [C] The impact almost immediately sent a shower of debris raining across much of North and South America and generated huge waves that may have sloshed more than 1,000 kilometers inland. [D] Many North American species thus may have been wiped out shortly after impact.
Question: As a result, molten material was pushed out toward the north with small glass spheres found more than 2,500 kilometers to the northwest.
Answer: C

Context: In 1927, another early theory of emotion that challenged the James-Lange theory was proposed by Walter Cannon. He claimed that physical changes caused by the diverse emotions are not sufficiently distinct to allow people to distinguish one emotion from another. [A] After Cannon stated his original theory, in 1934, it was further developed by physiologist Philip Bard. [B] The Cannon-Bard theory suggests that the following chain of events takes place when an emotion is felt. [C] Stimuli which trigger emotion are received by the senses and then are relayed simultaneously to the cerebral cortex, which imparts the conscious mental experience of the emotion, and to the sympathetic nervous system, which generates the physiological state of arousal. [D] In other words, the feeling of emotion occurs roughly the same time when the physiological arousal is experienced. One does not cause the other.
Question: The emotions of rage and fear, for instance, both include a rapid heartbeat, perspiration, and increased energy supplied to the muscles.
Answer: A

Context: [A] It is thought that some of the molecules created in the interstellar environment have survived the collapse of the gas and dust cloud that formed our solar nebula and Sun. [B] They would have been incorporated into solid materials that condensed out of the nebula and formed asteroids and comets. [C] Such materials might have been delivered to Earth in great quantities during the heavy bombardment period of solar system history, between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago. [D]
Question: As the modern study of a meteorite that crashed in western Canada has revealed, even today, organic compounds continuously arrive on Earth in this way.
Answer: D

Context: Perhaps more insidious is that a pesticide loses its effectiveness because the target species evolves resistance to it. As one pesticide replaces another, the pests acquire a resistance to them all.[A] Some species, notably certain mosquitoes, have overcome the toxic effects of every pesticide to which they have been exposed. [B] Insect pests need not only about five years to evolve pesticide resistance, their predators do so much more slowly.[C] So after the pest develops resistance, pest outbreaks become even more disastrous.[D]
Question: And the damage will continue until a new pesticide is developed, at which time the cycle will begin anew.
Answer: D

Context: Over the course of 2,000 hours of observation, no sentinels were attacked or killed by predators. They may actually be safer because they are the first to sense the predator. Moreover, they generally stand guard within 5 meters of a burrow, and are the first underground when a predator comes close. [A] If a meerkat’s personal safety is increased with serving as a sentinel, it would be possible to predict that an individual would spend a proportion of its time guarding, whether it was solitary or part of a group. [B] As predicted, individual meerkats spend about the same time on guard duty as members of large groups. [C] Groups with more members suffer less predation because there is a sentinel for a longer portion of foraging time than in small groups. [D] 
Question: This results in meerkats gaining an advantage in survival by gathering in large groups rather than small ones.
Answer: D

Context: Since portraits are distinct from other genres or art categories in the ways they are produced, the nature of what they represent, and how they function as objects of use and display, they are worthy of separate study. [A] First, during their production, portraits require the presence of a specific person, or an image of the individual to be represented, in almost all cases. [B] In the majority of instances the production of portraiture has necessitated sittings, which result in interaction between the subject(s) and artist throughout the creation of the work. [C] If the sitter is of high social standing or is occupied and unavailable to sit in the studio regularly, portraitists could use photographs or sketches of their subject. [D] In Europe, during the seventeenth and eighteenth century, the sitting time was sometimes decreased by focusing solely on the head and using professional drapery painters to finish the painting.
Question: In certain instances, portrait artists depended on a combination of direct and indirect involvement with their subjects.
Answer: C

Context: By mid 1500s，one quarter of all paddy land were used to double crop. The farmers not only used fields to grow two crops in a year, but they even grew three in a single annual cycle. [A] An envoy from Korea stated that Japanese farmers from Hyogo region would grow barley and sow in winter and harvest them in summer. [B] Followed by rice cropping in summer and fall, buckwheat was harvested in winter. [C] As time went on agriculture advanced, such technique progressed from generation to generation. [D] Farming became more consistent and the crop output became even greater. A greater sense of discipline in land tilling and wide range of crops being planted in the same piece of land broadened the understanding of agriculture in farmers.
Question: The potential benefit of this was not the amounts of crop output.
Answer: C

Context: As opposed to forests, grasslands receive markedly less precipitation. [A] This is one of the reasons why trees, which usually require a significant amount of moisture, are spaced relatively sparsely in grasslands. [B] Due to the facts that most grasslands are situated in the center of continental landmasses, and that costal mountain ranges can block west-to-east winds as is the case with the Great Plains in North America, air masses from the north and south are highly influential on grasslands. [C] The Great Plains receive cold Arctic air in winter and hot tropical air in summer. [D] A typical grassland climate includes hot summers with long periods of desiccation and cold winters with erratic snow cover.
Question: A typical grassland area averages only 25 to 100 centimeters per year.
Answer: A

Context: These changes in manufacture were accompanied by increased distances over which many goods were transported to their consumers. [A] The bulk of pottery and other items originated locally, during the Iron Age; but after the Roman invasion, these objects had been produced over a far greater range of distances. [B] In this way, vast regions of the Roman province were incorporated into a society where there was wide access to material wealth. [C] New changes in manufacturing production were coupled with huge increase in the importation of goods from elsewhere in the empire. [D] These commodities, which included Mediterranean foodstuffs such as olive oil as well as comparatively low-value objects such as decorated pottery, also achieved a wide distribution and are found in many different types of site.
Question: Furthermore, this provincial society was itself economically integrated with markets beyond its borders.
Answer: C

Context: In general, slower-growing corals are more aggressive than fast-growing species.[A] In cases where a competitor cannot be overcome, however, corals may survive by taking advantage of differences in local habitats.[B] Massive corals are generally more shade tolerant and able to survive at greater depths.[C] Therefore, on many reefs it is the fast-growing, branching corals that ultimately dominate at the upper, shallower portion of the reef, whereas more massive forms dominate in deeper areas.[D]
Question: For example, different species of corals have different needs for light.
Answer: B

Context: The way in which birds reached the Hawaiian Islands is obvious enough. [A] Some of the plants that probably came with them had seeds that readily attached to feathers, about 7 percent of the Hawaiian nonendemic (nonnative) seed plants probably arrived in this way. [B] The Hawaiian insects, too, arrived by air. [C] Entomologists have used airplanes and ships to trail fine nets over the Pacific at different heights and have trapped a variety of insects, most of which, as would be expected, are light-bodied. [D] These types also predominate in the Hawaiian Islands (an indication of their airborne arrival), although heavier dragonflies, sphinx moths, and butterflies are also found there.
Question: Flying over from the American mainland or from other Pacific Islands, they often brought additional colonists with them.
Answer: A

Context: A last theory differs from the others in suggesting that it is the presence of dipterocarp trees themselves that is promoting the evolution of gliding species. [A] According to this theory, dipterocarp forests can be "food-deserts" for the animals that live in them. [B] The animals living in dipterocarp forests that have developed gliding divide into two main groups: leaf eaters and carnivores that eat small prey such as insects and small vertebrates. [C] For leaf-eating gliders the problems is not the absence of any leaves but the desert-like absence of edible leaves. Dipterocarp trees often account for 50 percent or more of the total number of canopy trees in a forest and over 95 percent of the large trees, yet dipterocarp leaves are unavailable to most vertebrate plant eaters because of the high concentration of toxic chemicals in their leaves. [D] Many species of gliding animals avoid eating dipterocarp leaves and so must travel widely through the forest, bypassing the dipterocarp tree, to find the leaves they need to eat.
Question: For each group, a dipterocarp forest is like a desert in that food resources are few and far apart.
Answer: C

Context: The structure of the genotype itself imposes limits on the power of natural selection. The classical metaphor of the genotype was that of a beaded string on which the genes were lined up like pearls in a necklace.[A] According to this view, each gene was more or less independent of the others. [B] Not much is left of this previously accepted image. [C] It is now known that there are different functional classes of genes, some charged to produce material, others to regulate it, and still others that are apparently not functioning at all.[D] There are single coding genes, moderately repetitive DNA, highly repetitive DNA, and many other kinds of DNA. Discovering exactly how they all interact with one another is still a rather poorly understood area of genetics.
Question: New models of the genotype depict a much more complicated relationship among genes.
Answer: C

Context: The Natufians were hunter-gatherers who relied primarily on gazelle, although they also cultivated some cereal grains. [A] During the early period at least, they lived year-round in villages in built stone houses. Like all human beings, their way of life depended on the climate. [B] Around 13,000 years ago, their climate began to change, becoming colder and drier, a period known as the Younger Dryas.[C] We know that times were hard in the increasingly arid landscapes of the Younger Dryas, but quite how hard remains unclear. [D] The droughts certainly caused many ponds and rivers to disappear completely and the larger lakes to shrink in size.
Question: As long as the climate remained moderate, the Natufians were able to thrive by remaining in their villages.
Answer: B

Context: Organisms that utilize different resources at different stages of their life cycle face an unusual evolutionary problem, exploiting different niches may be difficult with a single body plan. [A] The solution is a juvenile (immature) form specialized for one niche, followed by metamorphosis to an entirely new body plan, adapted to a different niche in the adult. [B] Clearly, species that metamorphose must undertake complex genetic and physiological processes in the transformation. [C] These changes require complex regulatory mechanisms that involve turning on and off many genes at appropriate times. [D] In addition, the reorganization of the body plan in a metamorphic species entails considerable energy costs. What sorts of ecological advantages could outweigh these complications?
Question: Metamorphosis, however, comes with its own set of difficulties.
Answer: B

Context: Ladd and other geologists reported borings at Eriwetok atoll in the Marshall Islands that penetrated 1,283meters of reef limestone and then hit volcanic rock. [A] This was the evidence that Darwin’s theory was substantially correct. [B] The correctness of this theory has been strengthened by the discovery of flat-topped mountains or guyots that, at present, have their tops many hundreds or thousands of meters below the ocean surface, but have on their surface the remains of shallow water corals. [C] Evidently, these mountains sank too fast for reef growth to keep above the ocean surface. [D]
Question: Had subsidence occurred more slowly, the reefs would have eventually become atolls.
Answer: D

Context: [A] A single Acanthaster can consume five to six square meters of coral polyps per year, and dense populations can destroy up to six square kilometers per year and move on rapidly. [B] Acanthaster show a preference for branching corals, especially Acroporids. [C] After an outbreak in a particular area, it is common to find that Acroporids have been selectively removed, leaving a mosaic of living and dead corals. [D] In places where Acroporids previously dominated the community devastation can be almost complete, and local areas of reefs have collapsed.
Question: The crown of thorns starfish is a coral reef predator that preys on coral polyps.
Answer: A

Context: The economic argument is linked in part to the geographic. [A] The Moscow river served as an important trade artery, and as the Muscovite principality expanded around its waterways, it profited by and in turn helped to promote increasing economic intercourse.[B] One school of thought has treated the expansion of Moscow largely in terms of the growth of a common market. [C] Another economic approach emphasizes the success of the Muscovite princes in developing agriculture in their domains and supporting colonization. [D] These princes clearly outdistance their rivals in obtaining peasants to settle on their lands.
Question: Scholars have debated the relative importance of various economic factors in the principality's overall success.
Answer: B

Context: Volcanic eruptions, retreating glaciers, and bare sand dunes are examples of sites subject to primary succession, while clear-cutting of forests, wild fires, and hurricanes are examples of sites subject to secondary succession. [A] Hundreds to thousands of years are required for primary succession to reach the climax sere, compared to decades to hundreds of years for it to occur in secondary succession. [B] A longer time is needed to reach the climax sere for primary than secondary succession because soil development must first take place in primary succession. [C] The rate of succession is dependent upon the extent of the disturbance and the availability of appropriate seeds for recolonization. [D]
Question: Tree species that have small, light seeds that are dispersed by wind or transported by animals recolonize a disturbed area more quickly than species with large seeds.
Answer: B

Context: The English textile trade was closely dyed to Antwerp, in the Spanish Netherlands, where workers died English cloth. [A] The entrepreneur Sir Thomas Gresham became England's representative there. [B] He so enhanced the reputation of English business in that region that English merchants could operate on credit---the most prominent achievement for sixteenth century. [C] He also advised the government to explore the economic possibilities of Americas, which led to the first concerted efforts at colonization, undertaken with commercial profits in mind. [D] 
Question: In addition to this achievement in Antwerp, Gresham convinced the government at home in England to authorize actions that would make trading in the rest of Europe even more profitable for English merchants.
Answer: C

Context: However, interrupting the middle of the dark period with just a minute or two of lights prevents flowering. [A] Thus their flowering is controlled by the length of continuous darkness. [B] It is evident that even brief exposure to sunlight or white light will reset their biological clocks. [C] The color of the light used for the light exposure is also important. A nighttime flash of pure red light inhibits flowering, while flash of light at the far-red end of the spectrum has no effect on flowering, as if no light were detected.[D]
Question: But not all types of light will have this effect.
Answer: C

Context: The first is heightened competition for food, which occurs in animals as different as colonial fieldfares (a kind of songbird) and groups of lions, whose females are often pushed from their food by hungry males. [A] The second is increased vulnerability to parasites and disease, which plague social species of all sorts. [B] While it is true that some social animals have evolved special responses designed to combat parasites and disease, those responses can only reduce, but cannot totally eliminate, the damage caused by those threats, and the responses may even carry their own costs. [C] Thus, honeybees warm their hives in response to an infestation by a fungal pathogen, which apparently helps kill the heat-sensitive fungus, but at the price of time and energy expended by the heat-producing workers. [D] 
Question: Likewise, termites can reduce their risk of some infectious diseases by associating with other termites, but only at the expense of decreased physiological functioning.
Answer: D

Context: The most famous short-period comet is Halley’s Comet, named after English astronomer Edmond Halley. [A] Its orbital period averages 76 years, and every one of its 30 appearances since 240 B.C. has been recorded by Chinese astronomers. [B] When seen in 1910, Halley’s Comet had developed a tail nearly 1.6 million kilometers (1 million miles) long and was visible during daylight hours. [C] Its most recent approach occurred in 1986. [D] 
Question: It was not until 1705, however, that Halley determined that each of these appearances was actually a reappearance of the same object.
Answer: B

Context: In Concurd, one of every four adult males migrated from town every decade from the 1740s on, and in many towns migration out was even greater. [A] Some drifted south to New York and Pennsylvania. [B] Others sought opportunities as artisans in the coastal towns or took to the sea. [C] More headed for the colonies, western frontier or north into New Hampshire and the eastern frontier of Maine. [D] Several thousand New England families migrated even farther north to the Annapolis Valley of Nova Scotia.
Question: A third of Northampton's men over 21 years old left, joining the stream of departing New Englanders.
Answer: A

Context: The edges of ponds and streams surely had scattered dead fish and other water-dwelling creatures. [A] In addition, plants had emerged into terrestrial habitats in areas near streams and ponds, and crabs and other arthropods were also members of this earliest terrestrial community.[B] Thus, by the Devonian the land habitat marginal to freshwater was probably a rich source of protein that could be exploited by an animal that could easily climb out of water.[C] Evidence from teeth suggests that these earliest tetrapods did not utilize land plants as food; they were presumably carnivorous and had not developed the ability to feed on plants.[D] 
Question: These would have been deposited by the receding waters of droughts, during which many aquatic animals must have died.
Answer: A

Context: Kohler argues that pinon was disappearing from the locale of settlements and that this put an additional nutritional strain on the population, which used nuts from the tree as well as its wood. [A] The relative proportion of different species of animals hunted by people in the region also changed progressively. [B] A final source of evidence was the seeds found in the archaeological deposits, which had blown or been brought to the settlement. [C] As time went on, there was a substantial increase in seeds from pioneer plants, attesting both to agricultural intensification and to an increasingly disturbed local environment. [D] 
Question: Earlier, they had pursued animals native to woodlands such as deer and rabbit and later, those more at home in open or disturbed environments such as antelope and jackrabbit.
Answer: B

Context: Salinization is caused by an accumulation of salt in the soil near its surface. [A] This salt is carried by river water from the sedimentary rocks in the mountains and deposited on the Mesopotamian fields during natural flooding or purposeful irrigation. Evaporation of water sitting on the surface in hot climates is rapid, concentrating the salts in the remaining water that then descends through the soil to the underlying water table. [B] In southern Mesopotamia, for example, the natural water table comes to within roughly six feet of the surface. [C] Conditions of excessive irrigation bring the water table to eighteen inches, and water can rise further to the root zone, where the high concentration of salts would kill most plants.[D] 
Question: Natural flooding, however, does not raise the water table nearly as much and thus does not have these sorts of consequences.
Answer: D

Context: This means that when we observe quasars today we are seeing that state of the universe billions of years ago. [A] Thus the fact that almost all quasars are very far away implies that earlier in the history of the universe quasars were developing more frequently than they are now. [B] This evolution is consistent with the Big Bang theory. [C] But it violates the perfect cosmological principle, and so it is inconsistent with the steady-state view. [D] 
Question: In turn this means that over a period of billions of years the large-scale distribution of the kinds of galaxies the universe contains has fundamentally changed.
Answer: A

Context: Europe’s overall population growth from 1050 to 1300 had been primarily due to an increase in the number of rural folk. [A] But as economic forces made agrarian life more perilous around 1300, hard-pressed farmers and their families began to migrate to the cities in large numbers in search of work. [B] Many cities doubled in size, and some even tripled, over the course of just one or two generations. [C] Few were capable of absorbing such large numbers of people.[D]
Question: Farms, villages, and entire regions were abandoned.
Answer: B

Context: The most extensive studies of cognitive maps have been made for animals exhibit seasonal migration, the regular back-and-forth movement of animals between two geographic areas at particular times of the year. [A] Seasonal migration enables many species to access rich food resources throughout the year and to breed or winter in areas that favor survival. [B] One long-distance traveler is the gray whale. [C] During summer, these giant aquatic mammals feast on small, bottom-dwelling invertebrates that abound in northern oceans. [D] In the autumn, they leave their northern feeding grounds and begin a long trip south along the North American coastline.
Question: For a variety of animals, there are two clear purposes for this behavior.
Answer: A

Context: In 1558 Giovanni Battista Della Porta wrote in his twenty-volume work Magia naturalis (meaning “natural magic”) instructions for adding a convex lens to improve the quality of the image thrown against a canvas or panel in the darkened area where its outlines could be traced. [A] Later, portable camera obscures were developed, with interior mirrors and drawing tablets on which the artist could trace the image. [B] For the artist, this technique allows forms and linear perspective to be drawn precisely as they would be seen from a single viewpoint. [C] Mirrors were also used to reverse the projected images to their original positions. [D] 
Question: All these developments helped artists to create accurate images of objects, people, and scenes.
Answer: D

Context: Birds kept in the lab under a winter photoperiod of nine hours of light and fifteen hours of darkness preferred (spent more time in front of) slides of their southern winter habitat. [A] After day length was increased to fifteen hours of light and nine hours of darkness, the birds’ viewing preferences shifted to the northern summer habitat. [B] Social cues may also affect choice of habitat. [C] Large juncos (usually males) dominate smaller individuals (usually females and juveniles) in wintering flocks. [D] Biologist Ellen Ketterson explained the finding that females usually migrate farther south than males by hypothesizing that subordinate birds are forced to migrate farther to avoid competing with dominants.
Question: However, photoperiod is not the only factor in the habitat selection of this bird species.
Answer: B

Context: A problem with Milankovitch’s explanation of glaciation arises from the fact that the variations in Earth’s orbit, and hence the Milankovitch cycles, have existed for billions of years. [A] Thus we might expect that glaciation would have been a cyclic event throughout geologic time. In fact, periods of glaciation are rare. [B] So there must be another factor acting together with the Milankovitch cycles that causes periods of glaciation. [C] Once this additional factor makes the temperature low enough, the cyclic variations of the Milankovitch cycles will force the planet into and out of glacial epochs with a fixed regularity.[D] 
Question: This factor must precede an ice age and have the effect of slightly lowering Earth’s temperature.
Answer: C

Context: When people arrived on these islands, they found easy prey. [A] For example, when Polynesians, now known as Maori, arrived in New Zealand about A.D. 1200, the islands had 11 species of moas: flightless birds that ranged in size from as small as a turkey to larger than an ostrich. [B] By the time Europeans colonized the islands in the 1700s, the moas were gone, along with five species of rail and six waterfowl species. [C] The demise of the moas and other birds undoubtedly was hastened by forest clearing and other changes brought about by the Maori, but the abundance of moa remains at Maori village sites makes it clear that hunting was a major factor.[D] 
Question: Indeed, some evidence suggests that these extinctions occurred long before, perhaps as early as 100 years after Polynesian colonization.
Answer: C

Context: Another way animals and insects ensure that their calls connect with the intended receivers is by developing their own specialized frequencies, which are determined primarily by the size of their bodies. [A] Recently, a scientist visiting the Peruvian rain forest made an audiotape of a little of the night’s music. [B] When he took the tape back to his lab and analyzed it, he discovered that this seemingly chaotic banquet of sound was actually highly ordered. [C] Each animal and insect is tuned to and calling on its own species-specific frequency, in the same way that radio stations use different signals so that many stations can broadcast at the same time.[D] 
Question: Indeed, there were numerous layers of sound, each clearly distinct from the others.
Answer: C

Context: An opposite extreme was to farm at the warmer low elevations, but there the rainfall is insufficient even for dryland agriculture. [A] The Hohokam got around that problem by constructing the most extreme irrigation system in the Americas outside Peru. [B] But irrigation entailed the risk that human digging of ditches and canals could lead to sudden heavy water runoff from rainstorms, digging further down into the ditches and canals and carving out deep channels called arroyos. [C] In that case, the water level would drop below the field level, making irrigation impossible for people without pumps. [D] 
Question: Another risk of irrigation was that floods could simply wash away the dams and channels, as indeed may have happened eventually to the Hohokam.
Answer: D

Context: Some historians argue that the invention of mechanical printing gave rise to a communications revolution as significant as, for example, the widespread use of the personal computer today. [A] The multiplication of standardized texts altered the thinking habits of Europeans by freeing individuals from having to memorize everything they learned; it certainly made possible the speedy and inexpensive dissemination of knowledge. [B] It created a wilder community of scholars, no longer dependent on personal patronage or church sponsorship for texts. [C] Printing facilitated the free expression and exchange of ideas, and its disruptive potential did not go unnoticed by political and church authorities. [D] Emperors and bishops in Germany, the homeland of the printing industry, moved quickly to issue censorship regulations.
Question: For such leaders, the uncontrolled expression of ideas was clearly unwelcome.
Answer: D

Context: The process of discovery often shapes what we know about the history of Mesoamerican art. New finds are just as often made accidentally as intentionally. [A] In 1971 workers installing sound and light equipment under the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan stumbled upon a remarkable cave that has since been interpreted by some scholars as a royal burial chamber. [B] Archaeology has its own fashions too: the isolation of new sites may be the prime goal in one decade and the excavation of pyramids the focus in the next. In a third decade, outlying structures rather than principal buildings may absorb archaeologists’ energies. [C] Nor should one forget that excavators are vulnerable to local interests. [D] At one point, reconstruction of pyramids to attract tourism may be desired; at another, archaeologists may be precluded from working at what has already become a tourist attraction.
Question: The chance discovery has done as much for our understanding of the pyramid as any systematic study would have.
Answer: B

Context: Topography is a major factor in soil development. [A] More water runs off and less enters the soil on steep slopes than on relatively level land. [B] Water draining from slopes enters the soil on low and flat land. [C] Thus soils and soil material tend to be dry on slopes and moist on wet on the low land. [D] Steep slopes are subject to surface erosion and soil creep—the downslope movement of soil material, which accumulates on lower slopes and lowlands.
Question: Its role is demonstrated by the contrast between what happens on steep slopes and what happens on the lower-lying land at the bottom of those slopes.
Answer: A

Context: This first phase of civilization is called the Bronze Age because of the importance of metal technology. The most characteristic Near Eastern Bronze Age civilizations, those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were located in river valleys, were based on the extensive exploitation of agriculture, and supported large populations. [A] Bronze was a valuable commodity in these civilizations, the copper and tin needed for its manufacture did not exist in river valleys and had to be imported. [B] Bronze was therefore used mainly for luxury items, such as jewelry or weapons, not for everyday domestic items, which were made from pottery, animal products, wood, and stone. [C] In particular, bronze was not used for farming tools. [D] Thus, early civilizations based on large-scale agriculture, such as those of Mesopotamia and Egypt, were feasible only in soils that could be worked by wooden plows pulled by people or draft animals such as oxen.
Question: This significantly limited the availability of bronze.
Answer: B

Context: Thus, hunters have to plan in advance and in great detail. [A] They need reliable information about the movements and habits of animal prey over large areas, which can be secured only by maintaining regular contacts with neighboring groups. [B] Finally, they need reliable methods of storage because, where plant foods cannot provide a dietary safety net, planning has to be precise and detailed to ensure that there is enough to tide them over in periods of shortage. [C] Such planning appears in the choice of hunting gear, in the selection of routes and prey, in the choice of companions and timing, in the maintenance of communications with neighbors, and in the methods of storage. [D] Failure at any point can be fatal for the entire group.
Question: The consequences of inadequate planning are serious.
Answer: D

Context: [A] In recent years, one of the most significant advances in Mesoamerican archaeology has come from deciphering many of the inscribed symbols (glyphs) on the stone stelae (pillars or columns) at the largest centers. [B] It had been widely assumed that the inscriptions were exclusively of a calendrical nature or that they dealt with purely religious matters, notably the deeds of the gods. [C] But the inscriptions can now in many cases be interpreted as relating to real historical events, mainly the deeds of the Maya kings. [D] We can now also begin to deduce the likely territories belonging to individual Maya centers. Maya history has thus taken on a new dimension.
Question: Being able to accurately interpret an ancient language has in many cases transformed our knowledge about the society that used it.
Answer: A

Context: There is another completely different style of living.[A] Poikilotherms are organisms whose body temperature conforms to that of the ambient environment. [B] All subtidal marine invertebrates and most fishes fit into this category. [C] There is an interesting intermediate status in which body temperature is usually somewhat higher than ambient temperature. [D] Strong-swimming fishes, such as skipjack tuna and yellowfin tuna, have this intermediate status. Their rise in temperature above ambient conditions stems from metabolic heat generated by muscular activity (swimming) combined with a heat retention mechanism.
Question: However, not all marine organisms can be easily classified as either homeotherms or poikilotherms.
Answer: C

Context: The EuropeanMesolithic (roughly the period from 8000 B.C to 2700 B.C) testifies to a continuity in human culture from the times of the Ice Age. [A] This continuity, however, was based on continuous adjustment to environmental change following the end of the last glacial period (about 12,500 years ago). [B] Three broad subdivisions within the northern Mesolithic are known in Scandinavia.[C] The Maglemose Period (7500-5700 B.C.) was a time of seasonal exploitation of rivers and lakes, combined with terrestrial hunting and foraging. [D] The sites from the Kongemose Period (5700-4600 B.C) are mainly on the Baltic Sea coasts, along bays and near lagoons, where the people exploited both marine and terrestrial resources. Many Kongemose sites are somewhat larger than Maglemose ones.
Question: Such adaptation involved changes in hunting and food gathering that make it possible to identify distinct Mesolithic periods and cultures in some regions.
Answer: B

Context: Most botanists now agree that the flowering plants are monophyletic in origin, meaning that they evolved from a common ancestor. [A] Some paleontologists have suggested that the common ancestor may have been a type of cycad (palmlike tropical plants). [B] Other paleontologists maintain that the angiosperms may have evolved from seed-bearing ferns. [C] Finally, analysis of the morphological traits of some primitive living plants suggests that the ancestor may have been related to the modern pines. [D] The question of angiosperm ancestry remains unresolved.
Question: But their origin and evolution have been under considerable dispute.
Answer: A

Context: In open grasslands there is no place for a large animal to hide. [A] Thus a watchful grazing animal will see the slight movement that betrays the presence of a predator long before it is close enough to launch an attack. It sounds as though the hunters (predators) stand no chance at all. [B] Unfortunately for the grazers, life is not so simple, however. [C] A grazing animal must lower its head and look at the ground to feed. [D] Its attention may be occupied for only a few seconds before it raises its head and resumes its watch while chewing the food it took, but hunters are patient and skillful and are concentrating intensely.
Question: This is because grasslands lack the trees and heavy bush to provide cover for anything but very small animals.
Answer: A

Context: The Beringian landscape was very different from what it is today. [A] Broad, windswept valleys, glaciated mountains, sparse vegetation, and less moisture created a rather forbidding land mass. [B] This land mass supported herds of now-extinct species of mammoth, bison, and horse and somewhat modern versions of caribou, mush ox, elk, and saiga antelope. [C] These grazers supported in turn a number of impressive carnivores, including the giant short-faced bear, the saber-tooth cat, and a large species of lion. [D]
Question: Nevertheless, large animals managed to survive in Beringia.
Answer: B

Context: Wind pollination does, of course, require a lot of pollen. [A] Birch and hazel trees can produce 5.5 and 4 million grains per catkin, respectively. [B] There are various adaptations to help as much of the pollen go as far as possible. [C] Most deciduous wind-pollinated trees (which shed their leaves every fall) produce their pollen in the spring while the branches are bare of leaves to reduce the surrounding surfaces that “compete” with the stigmas (the part of the flower that receives the pollen) for pollen. [D] Evergreen conifers, which do not shed their leaves, have less to gain from spring flowering, and, indeed, some flower in the autumn or winter.
Question: This level of volume is important to ensure that at least some of the pollen reaches a target tree, but dispersing the pollen is crucial as well.
Answer: B

Context: [A] In the deeper waters of the oceans, there is a much greater tendency for animals to await the arrival of food particles or prey rather than to search them out actively (thus minimizing energy expenditure). [B] This has resulted in a more stealthy style of feeding, with the consequent emphasis on lures and/or the evolution of elongated appendages that increase the active volume of water controlled or monitored by the animal. [C] Another consequence of the limited availability of prey is that many animals have developed ways of coping with much larger food particles, relative to their own body size, than the equivalent shallower species can process. [D] Among the fishes there is a tendency for the teeth and jaws to become appreciably enlarged.
Question: Such a passive approach requires those animals to develop specialized methods of acquiring food.
Answer: B

Context: [A] Engineer keystone species maintain the balance in ecosystems in different ways. [B] Although bears tend to live in forests, they bring in important sources of nutrients from ocean and sea-based ecosystems. [C] The bears capture large salmon from the water and take them into the forest to eat them. [D] This distributes large amounts of protein in the form of bear waste matter as well as uneaten portions of salmon.
Question: The bears that live on the West Coast of North America are often cited as an engineer species.
Answer: B

Context: [A] It is thought that some of the molecules created in the interstellar environment have survived the collapse of the gas and dust cloud that formed our solar nebula and Sun. [B] They would have been incorporated into solid materials that condensed out of the nebula and formed asteroids and comets. [C] Such materials might have been delivered to Earth in great quantities during the heavy bombardment period of solar system history, between 4.5 and 3.8 billion years ago. [D]
Question: The origin of life on Earth has been the subject of scientific study, and several theories developed to clarify it.
Answer: D
